Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

Please note that I do not regularly have my girlfriend shove crutches up my a*s . 

This refers to an isolated incident of about 3 years ago of joking around with her and a mutual friend where they basically poked at my ( clothed ) butt with a crutch . 

They ended up hitting me in the nuts , which , to say the least , was probably better than what the director of this film did to the memory of Dr.Seuss . 

Tonight , I feel violated . 

Yes , even more violated than the incident above made me feel . 

And I feel more violated for one simple reason above all : I paid to be violated tonight . 

I paid to be violated by Mike Myers , Bo Welch ( director ) , and Alec Berg , David Mandel , and Jeff Schaffer ( the writers ) . 

I paid to see one of my most cherished childhood authors , Dr.Seuss , be violated in the most basic sense of the term . 

I had such high hopes for this flick ( calling this a'film' would be an insult to true'films' ) , and I honestly thought that Myers would be able to bring a spastic , if childlike charm , to the role of The Cat . 

But there is nothing charming about Myers or his Cat , or this abomination they dare to put Dr. Seuss' name on . 

Sure , it's all based on characters created by the good doctor years ago , but it all feels like one big bathroom joke that isn't funny in the very least . 

Hell , I might've laughed more the one time I was forced to sit through Biodome than I laughed at this garbage . 

The plot , if one can call it that , revolves around a pair of children , Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) and Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) who are as opposite as opposite can get . 

Conrad is a little hell raiser , while Sally is the goody two shoes who mommy ( Joan , played by Kelly Preston ) adores . 

Alec Baldwin plays a seedy next door neighbor who is dating Joan , and whose one goal in life is seemingly to be as disgusting as possible while making sure Conrad gets shipped off to military school so he can move in . 

As mom plans to host a big party at home for her obsessive compulsive neat freak boss ( Mr. Humberfloob , played by Sean Hayes ) , the kids are told not to ruin the house , and are left with a noodling , overweight babysitter who falls asleep faster than Granpa does on The Simpsons . 

Enter the Cat , who helps to ruin the house , anger the kids , and pull so many shenanigans in one day your head will spin...or hurt . 

While the last Dr. 

Seuss big screen adaptation wasn't anything all that hot either ( The Grinch ) , at least it felt like it had some of that Dr. Seuss heart to it , and Jim Carrey at least brought something to the role that so many thought he didn't belong in . 

This however , doesn't work in the least . 

Myers spends the whole movie acting as if he had 6 too many Jolt colas , and when he isn't completely aping one of his better known characters ( i .e . 

Fat Bastard from the Austin Powers series ) , his main Cat voice sounds like a mix of Powers and his SNL alter-ego Linda Richman . 

It's f*cking embarrassing and not the least bit funny . 

In fact , I found it rather irritating and about 20 minutes after his first appearance , I suddenly longed to be in any other theatre , even if it would have meant seeing the biggest chick flick of all time . 

The so-called'humor ,' as mentioned above , is so pandering , so foul , and so UN-SEUSS , that you'll wonder how in the world this ever got the OK from good old Ted's estate ( Evidently a few million bucks is worth the price of a man's legacy ) . 

If there is one good thing about this movie , it is that Seuss' legacy lives on in the imaginative , bright , and colorful sets , backgrounds , and costumes ( Myers' Cat suit aside ) . 

This , along with the two kids' performances , are the only things worthwhile about this movie , and trust me , they aren't even worth the price of a RENTAL , nevermind a full price ticket to a theatre . 

I hope Mike Myers is happy with this gigantic piece of donkey crud he dared to make . 

I hope that Bo Welch gets run out of Hollywood for this . 

And I hope whoever it is that takes care of Dr.Seuss' estate and actually approved this movie being made and released ends up in the fiery depths of hell . 

I didn't think it would be possible for anyone to rip the heart out of a Dr. Seuss book ...and just when you didn't think it was possible , along came Hollywood . 

Yeah folks , I feel violated . 

Don't let this happen to you . 

Just go see Elf with Will Ferrell instead . 

Synopsis : Sally and Conrad learn to set limits on their misadventure , with a little help from Dr Seuss' ( Theodor S. Geisel ) Cat in the Hat ( 1957 ) . 

Analysis : There may not be many things that I'm sure of , but I do know a few for absolute certain . 

Leg-warmers will never make a come-back , DavidK93 IS gay , JackSommersby is NOT gay , and the world would be a much better place if every adult and child read ( and understood ) Dr. Seuss' books . 

In fact , referring to them as children's literature is a misnomer . 

There's not a single example of Seussian literature that fails to transcend any preconceived notion of what it means to be young , old or somewhere in the middle . 

All the Places You'll Go has helped through many a difficult transition . 

I've vowed never to live through a holiday season when I don't watch the animated How the Grinch Stole Christmas ! 

( 1966 ) at least a dozen times . 

I've even prepared green eggs and ham on a date (you could say that I ate them with a fox ) . 

So , yes , I always have been and forever will be a Dr. Suess fanatic . 

If he were still alive today , I might even have stalkerish tendencies . 

But this review isn't about my clearly irrational desire to live in the world of Dr. Suess , it's about how Bo Welch's ( henceforth referred to as Bo Grinch ) cinematic adaptation of Seuss' Cat in the Hat has robbed me of my childhood memories . 

I'll begin with the only element of Cat in the Hat that I found acceptable -- the Seussian visuals . 

Flip through any Seuss book and you'll find some of the most colorful , creative and inspiring illustrations that exist . 

Seuss never saw any reason not to redraw that which already exists , and neither did Bo Grinch . 

Through a nice combination of animation and set-design , Seussian architecture lives on . 

The design team had fun with the landscape , the houses , the trees , the cars , and everything under the sun ( although , surprisingly , nothing above the sun ) . 

This creative re-engineering draws the viewer ( or reader ) into a parallel universe where age-old lessons can be taught or re-taught without the obstructions created in the minds of this one . 

Drawing things as they've never been drawn has also helped to maintain the timeless nature of Seuss' work , and avoids the pitfalls of stereotypes and geographic isolation . 

But this is where the film turns from Seussian into a a blueprint for disaster . 

The illustration is just one element in the greater scheme . 

To think of Dr. Seuss' work as mere pictures , rhymes and morals is to insult his legacy . 

Dr. Seuss was a creative visionary who never set any limits on imagination , and this is where Cat in the Hat fails to live-up to expectations . 

Bo Grinch has obviously lived inside a box for his entire life . 

He compromises on everything that made Dr. Seuss great in order to make a few ( billion ) bucks , and squanders every opportunity to build on greatness . 

I have no problem with people that value money above all else , but please limit your destruction to that which is yours . 

The rights to Seuss' words might be yours , but his legacy is not ! 

He tries feebly to introduce new characters ( Mr. Humberfloob , Quinn ) and expand on old ones , but these fall far short of expectations . 

The liberties taken with the story mortalize a once timeless tale . 

The most difficult hurdle to overcome was turning a story that is slightly longer than this review into a 1 hour and 15 minute feature length film . 

This leads to Bo Grinch's biggest mistake , allowing Mike Myers to run willy-nilly through the minds and hearts of the audience in the guise of the Cat in the Hat . 

It seemed to me that Myers forgot that he isn't on Saturday Night Live , playing to a largely adult audience . 

I kept wondering when he was going to be verklempt , and half expected his coos of " Wowwoo! " to be followed by " Wayne's World ! 

Wayne's World ! 

Party Time ! Excellent ! " 

Indeed , Mike Myers recycled his entire CV of SNL characters to create a Cat in the Hat that is unworthy of his name . 

I've long admired Mike Myers , and appreciate much of his work . 

This simply wasn't the venue for him to enlist his own brand of creative devices . 

Sean Hayes shines through the rest of cast , but only in one of his roles . 

I found him entirely unconvincing as Mr. Humberfloob , the mother's slave-driving germaphobe of a boss . 

As the fish , he's wonderful . 

For a character whose sole purpose is to antagonize the Cat in the Hat , he is surprisingly tolerable . 

I think Alec Baldwin ( Quinn ) and Kelly Preston ( Mom ) do an adequate job , but I feel that their romantic relationship and the undercurrents of jealousy that come with it are entirely inappropriate for the story . 

Spencer Breslin ( Conrad ) and Dakota Fanning ( Sally ) are just children themselves , and can't be held responsible for the awkwardness that is brought about by Bo Grinch and his grinchy ways . 

( I also have to agree with flamepillar's assessment that the Things are unnecessarily creepy ) 

It's the potty humor , though , that I find the most offensive . 

( Yes , I realize that I'm the same person who's always saying there isn't enough nudity , but even I ascribe to some sense of good taste ) The references to a dirty hoe and a Playboy centerfold were entirely unnecessary . 

I realize that younger children might not get them , but then WHY include them ? 

Adults have never found this necessary to enjoy Seuss' books ; and spoiling the pristine , although sometimes misunderstood , image of the Cat in the Hat is a low blow -- even for Mike Myers . 

Final Comments : I've droned on for far too long about a film that can be summed up in one ( of many ) four letter words ( s ) , Suck . 

Cat in the Hat is an abomination , which should be watched at the peril of your childhood . 

I never even got to see what it would be like to fly a kite in the house . 

I never got to see the Things bump the kites on the wall ! 

And we did not like it . 

Not one little bit . 

I realize that I love to rant and rave , but here are a few well-respected concurring opinions : anderclayton , kristinafh , flamepillar . 

Ok , not everyone agrees with me : dragonfire88 , Bruguru . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals no details about the movie's plot . 

This review is based on my own opinion as a family man and father of three boys , ages 4 , 8 and 11 . 

I consider myself a moderate person that is not overly protective or overly liberal . 

I believe parents are responsible to find a balance in making our kids aware of reality while at the same time protecting them ( and their innocence ) from it . 

I love Dr. Seuss stories . 

I grew up reading his books and still enjoy reading them to my sons . 

Shame on me for not checking the rating before taking the kids to the theater . 

I had assumed ( like I'm sure many of you would ) that it would be rated G. It's not . 

I think this rendition of the story would make Dr. Seuss roll over in his grave . 

The movie is absent 4-letter words and explicit sex scenes , but the inappropriate-for-children content and mature innuendos in this movie overshadow the story line and plot . 

There were enough instances that I cannot recall all of them , but multiple times during the movie I felt uncomfortable wondering if any of my three sons understood the inappropriate jokes . 

I later discovered my 11 year old understood all of them ( I wish he hadn't ) , my 8 year old understood about 1/2 of them , and my 4 year old is still innocent enough to understood none of them ( except the "butt scene " ) . 

The most memorable moments that I did not appreciate are the "butt scene " - where the cat was outfitted with a large bare bottom , using the term " Dirty Ho " - referring to a dirty gardening hoe , and an acronym for the cat's vehicle is S.H.I.T. 

This story is written more for parents who are Mike Meyers fans more than it is for small children . 

It is full of funny faces , personality shifts , and one-liners that are classic Meyers . 

Kids like the quick transition and can relate to the main characters who are a boy and girl . 

The story line and plot itself is poor and doesn't flow nearly as smooth as a Dr. Seuss's classic should . 

This rendition pales in contrast to the other Seuss classic that was released in recent years , " The Grinch" . 

In all fairness , my children enjoyed the movie . 

As an added bonus , my 8 year old said " Dirty Ho " for the first time and thanks to his older brother , now understands it too . 

This movie will leave you wanting more ... of NEMO , that is . 

I WOULD NOT SEE THIS HERE OR THERE , I WOULD NOT SEE THIS AGAIN ANYWHERE... 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

I grew up reading Dr. Seuss . 

Green Eggs and Ham , How the Grinch Stole Christmas , and The Cat in the Hat were some of my favorite books . 

When Ron Howard directed How the Grinch Stole Christmas back in 2000 , I was so excited . 

It was like seeing a childhood fantasy coming to life with Whoville and everything . 

That movie was so excellent . 

It was true to the original story and the acting , special effects , costumes , everything was incredible . 

It was like a page from the book . 

When Bo Welch decided to direct a movie version of The Cat in the Hat , I was equally excited . 

I guess I just thought that this movie would be as good as the Grinch , but unfortunately , it wasn't . 

This movie does not even come close to being half as good as How the Grinch Stole Christmas was . 

In fact , it was just one big disappointment from the start . 

Mike Myers stars as that lovable Cat who comes to make trouble while Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) and Conrad's ( Spencer Breslin ) mother ( Kelly Preston ) is out . 

Their mom is at work under pressure from her boss Mr. Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes , who created the voice of the Fish ) to throw a perfect dinner party that night ; otherwise , she will be F-I-R-E-D. 

When she receives a call that Conrad and Sally are causing trouble , she must make a quick trip home where the audience is then introduced to her boyfriend and neighbor , Quinn ( Alec Baldwin ) . 

Quinn has secret designs to send Conrad to military school and the kids must therefore find some way to expose him before their mom decides to get married . 

Enter Mrs. Kwan ( Amy Hill ) : the babysitter who loves to sleep. 

It starts raining , Conrad and Sally have been fighting , they hear a loud noise , go to see what it is , and discover an oversized cat . 

Cat promises them a fun-filled day where nothing will go wrong ; he even has them sign a contract . 

Little do Conrad and Sally know that Cat will only create many more problems for them with the use of his mysterious hat , including making their fish talk , destroying their house , and basically ruining their lives . 

But of course , every Dr. Seuss story has its moral and its happy ending . 

Conrad and Sally learn that they really love each other and should cooperate more with their mom . 

It's not the acting that makes this movie bad . 

In fact , the acting is the only saving grace of this film . 

Alec Baldwin is perfect as the nosy , two-faced neighbor who only has designs on Conrad and Sally's mom . 

The way he seems so sweet one minute and like the biggest villain the next , will have you loving him one minute and hating him the next . 

Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are both precious as the bickering sister and brother . 

Sally doesn't know how to have fun and Conrad only knows how to have fun . 

They are at the two extremes of the fun scale and have to find their way to the middle . 

Mike Myers is perfect as Cat . 

He's hilarious . 

There is just something about the way he says his lines that makes them so funny . 

It's just everything else about the film that is wrong . 

First , I'll start with the screenplay . 

This is such a classic children's book and yet Alec Berg's screenplay demolishes it . 

The movie changed things that were in the book and added some stuff that was never in there to begin with and didn't help the movie . 

I especially didn't like the fact that there seem to be a couple of sexual innuendos unappropriate for children and completely unnecessary in the film . 

The make-up wasn't too good either . 

The costume and make-up of Cat look so fake that it's not even funny . 

I know that it would be rather difficult to do make-up to make Mike Myers look like a cat , but honestly , they could have done a little bit better than they did . 

The Grinch was a completely fake creature , yet Jim Carrey looked perfect in that movie . 

The setting wasn't exactly what I had envisioned either . 

It didn't look like it had just "leapt " out of the book . 

Overall , I think little kids will like the movie . 

They won't know any different . 

Adults and anyone who has ever read the book won't be that impressed . 

I would highly recommend a different movie , such as Elf , if you're looking for a family movie that everyone will love . 

Wait to get this movie for the kids when it comes out on video , it's not really worth seeing in theaters . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot . 

OK , I'll admit it , I went to this movie with pretty low expectations , and they seemed to meet everyone of them . 

I have been a Dr Seuss fan since I first loved to read . 

Now I have two kids of my own and when the kids bring me a Dr Seuss book to read at bed time , I have as much fun reading it as they do hearing it . 

WARNING ! ! ! 

This gets long winded and I apologize for it , but there is so much to complain about . 

Overall Problems ( in my opinion ) : 

The Cat : Apparently the only thing Mike Myers had to base his character on was old copies of the Wizard of Oz . 

The cat looked too much like the lion AND laughed too much like the lion AND often sounded too much like the lion . 

I never met the Doc , but I have to believe after reading as much as I have of his material , the cat he had in mind was not a vulgar pervert with bad taste in music . 

I really thought for this part , someone would have put a leash on Mike Myers . 

The Language : 

While they never actually said any curse words , They got way too close on several occasions . 

Based on the load at the theatre I was at , and the fact that it's been on for about 5 days now , I'd guess that approx 1000 kids are going to be walking around school looking at one another and quoting the cat when he said " SON OF A BI..." , never actually saying it , but getting to close . 

Lots of kids will be saying with no understanding of what it was meant to imply , but would you want them to walk up in front of your parents , their teacher , someone at church , or someone in a store and spout off that phrase ? ? 

It was one of many . 

There is another scene where the boy starts to say SH** ( as a lady I used to work with would say ..." Sugar-Honey-Iced-Tea" ) . 

I think if this was going to be marketed to kids , Mike and the producers could have done a lot of house cleaning in this area . 

Alec Baldwin : 

Although it was a bit confusing to my 4 year old why Mr. Conductor from the Thomas the Tank movie was in the Cat In The Hat , Alec's character did a good job of being the guy any kid could hate . 

He taunts the boy to the point that you just want to see this kid really give him what's coming to him . 

What I didn't like was the over the top job they did on Alec's character making him the opposite of what the children's mother thought he was . 

We comes through the kitchen at one point carrying a 6 pack of beer , eating a sandwich , and burps in the kids faces . 

Then another scene shows home removing what looks like the "girdle " that surgery patients wear on their abdomen to prevent tearing the stitches . 

A LARGE gut comes rolling out and he proceeds to sit there being as gross as possible . 

The good points (ok , this should be quick ) 

Kelly Preston : If I really have to explain why she is in the "good " section , then you haven't seen her . 

( big grin ) 

The Story Line : 

OK , I'll give credit here , although I really didn't like the path they took to get there , the story line was basically the same . 

Fun is good , but only if you know when to stop . 

Some added touches ... 

The brother and sister who had issues before the adventure , were now a lot closer and even willing to stand up for one another . 

The mother who was starting to doubt not only her ability to raise her son , but also her son's ability to accept responsibility and do the things we was asked to do , now had now doubt that they would all be just fine together . 

Did I mention Kelly Preston yet ? ? 

Overall , this would be an ok movie for older kids , maybe , if they had a firm grasp on the understanding that some of the things you see on a movie are not acceptable in the real world . 

It would probably be a good teenager movie . 

It seemed to have a lot of the type of humor teens are accustomed to seeing . 

( not saying that's good or bad , just that this movie wouldn't be their first exposure to this type of humor ) . 

Imagine if you will , Mike Myers dressing the part of the Lion from the Wizard of OZ , and filming the next installment of Austin Powers dressed that way through the whole movie . 

If you haven't figured it out by now , I wasn't real impressed with this movie . 

Being a long time Doc fan , I didn't like the Grinch with Jim Carey , but it was a masterpiece compared to this one . 

I really hope that Horton Hear A Who isn't up for the next book to be butchered . 

Poor Dr. Seuss . 

I'm not sure if he should be angrier at his widow for giving studios the rights to his stories , or to the studios for stabbing his widow in the back when she trusted them . 

When THE GRINCH was made , it was a fun movie that could have been pushed further . 

But it was fun . 

I understand that the widow has control over what is going on during the writing process . 

In THE GRINCH she exercised a lot of , but not enough , control . 

In THE CAT IN THE HAT , the producers and writers took the rights they had and ran with them , putting things in that the widow , let alone Dr. Seuss , didn't and wouldn't have endorsed . 

Whether you loved or hated THE GRINCH , it's the Sistine Chapel compared to this monstrosity . 

We have a cliched story . 

The little girl , Sally , is a control freak . 

Her brother , Conrad , seems to make it his life mission to get into trouble . 

The babysitter comes to watch the children , and she falls asleep. 

Enter the Cat . 

The movie , which starts out almost promisingly , loses its grip as soon as the Cat enters . 

Funny , but I thought for sure it should pick up there , if anything . 

All day , the cat insists on doing outlandish things with the children , such as making cupcakes out of , literally , everything , and using the sleeping babysitter as a raft while going down a water slide . 

A lame and cliched subplot , about the mother's boyfriend wanting to send Conrad to military school , also takes place . 

One sexual joke after another follows . 

The cat lands on a garden hoe and exclaims " You dirty ho! Oh , just kidding . 

I love you , baby ! " 

When asked where he came from , the cat starts to explain " Well , when a mommy cat and a daddy cat love each other very much .. . " The most appalling sexual joke is when the cat's hat stiffens , like an erection , when he's looking at a picture of the kids' mother and asks " Who is that ? " 

It turns out the picture of her is constructed like a Playboy centerfold . 

And , of course , since Mike Meyers plays the Cat , it seems he is obligated to reference Austin Powers . 

Heck , the movie is one un-funny comedy sketch after another by Mike Meyers . 

To quote one critic , " It is difficult to tell who is less recognizable in this movie-- The Cat or Mike Meyers . " 

I think the cat . 

A cute , innocent story ( though some Freudians will argue that it's not such ) was taken and butchered by writers who feel that the only way to make this story work is to appeal to the lowest common denominator . 

If that's the case , then why even make this movie ? 

You wind up not disliking , but hating , all the characters in the movie . 

This movie is allegedly for kids , but I do not think it's suitable for most kids under 10 . 

I know that , even at 11 , I would have been disturbed by the sexual jokes in it , had I understood them . 

Hopefully , the silver lining around this mushroom cloud will be that kids have a new appreciation for the book and television special . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot . 

This is the first movie I have given an F to all year . 

I'm sure there are other F movies , but I try to avoid seeing those . 

When I read all the bad reviews I was in denial . 

My 7 year old daughter wanted to see it , so I gave it a shot . 

I am a Michael Myer fan and although " The Grinch " was not all that great , I found it watchable . 

What I got was a shameless commercial , plugging the soundtrack , the cat in the hat merchandise and UNIVERSAL STUDIOS ! ! ! 

I couldn't believe it , I was insulted . 

This movie has no value whatsoever . 

The story is non existent and Micheal Myers ( whom I usually enjoy ) compresses every character he's ever played into one big hairy annoying one . 

He even uses his " Fat Bastard " voice from Austin Powers . 

The visuals were good , Ill give it that . 

The colors and sets were Dr.Suessish . 

DOES ANYONE REMEMBER CAT IN THE HAT yelling " Bit*h " or getting hit in the privates with a bat . 

Or...referencing a dirty ho while holding a garden tool . 

Or belching ....or showing his buttcrack ! ! ! ! ! 

A dog even pees on someones food . 

If this is what Hollywood thinks is quality childrens entertainment...they are mistaken . 

Very innapropriate for children . 

It definitely takes a parent off guard to take their child to see , what you think will be a quality childrens movie , and get this terrible film . 

OK..OK...OK....now that I got that out of my system . 

Cat in the Hat is about 2 children living with there single mother . 

The young boy is a trouble maker , always getting into mischief and wrecking the house . 

The girl is like a 30 year old trapped in a 6 year old body . 

The mother is the typical workaholic mom who has no time for discipline . 

She is dating the neighbor man played by Alec Baldwin . 

He seems like a successful businessman , but behind closed doors , he's a drunken slob . 

Then as the mother goes off to work , the Cat in the Hat shows up to show these two kids how to have some fun . 

Thats about all the lot there is . 

The neighbor man tries to bust the kids , but of course he only makes himself look silly . 

If you'd like to know anything else ...please see the top of my review . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals no details about the movie's plot . 

The movie is overwrought and overdone . 

The plot is not the books . 

I know that movies are not supposed to be fully like the book but when practically every child ( as well as adult ) in America has read the Dr. Seuss books , this is unforgivable . 

The movies dont need to be fleshed out with over analytical information about why the Cat is who he is or with the history of their lives , but give it a rest . 

The good stuff.the 

visual production itself with its ultra-stylized appearance . 

It looks nice , but did the budget of a third world nation need to be spent to create this film ? 

The plot has added a bunch of new things to itand who cares . 

This is a short book which should have remained a cartoon classic on tv. 

With the holidays upon us and the mass merchandising , the movie is sure to be a hittoo bad as there are some other films that deserve to be seen . 

At less than 90 minutes , this movie is definitely too long . 

Youll probably have screaming kids who want to see this film.it is on steroids the way it runs all over the place but they may be entertained . 

Parents have two choices : lie and say the theatre went out of business . 

Or give in to the children and put up with their disappointment . 

Stale popcorn would be better than this movie . 

Somehow I think this movie will be better on video as seeing it on the smaller screen may make it appear to be less over produced . 

I am a bit familiar with the works of Dr. Seuss . 

The way his books have hit the big screen constitutes child abuse . 

Seuss was expert in how to write for children . 

The people who adapt his work to the big screen seem to have no clue what it's like to be a child . 

Neither does The Cat ( Mike Myers ) in the live-action version of " The Cat In The Hat . " Plot When he comes to the Walden residence , he scares young Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) and Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) . 

Their mother , realtor Joan Walden ( Kelly Preston ) has to report for work for her obsessive-compulsive boss , Hank Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes ) , even though she has to host a work-related party at her house that night . 

Meanwhile , Joan's boyfriend , Lawrence Quinn ( Alec Baldwin ) , encourages Joan to send Conrad , who's the unruly child , to military school . 

If her children are unruly , or the party fails in any other way , Hank promises Joan that she will lose her job . 

Joan calls on Mrs. Kwan ( Amy Hill ) to babysit her kids , and she promptly falls asleep. 

The Cat then proceeds to turn the house into a mess , with a little help from Thing 1 and Thing 2. The presence of The Cat throws the family fish (voiced by Hayes ) into a state of hysteria . 

The mess catches Lawrence's attention , and he heads to Joan's workplace to snitch on Sally and Conrad . 

When The Cat unleashes the Things from their crate , the family dog gets a hold of the lock . 

They have to retrieve the lock before the residence becomes a total wreck . 

They also have to head into town to thwart Lawrence . 

The Things create a diversion for Joan , while The Cat and the kids try to return everything to normal . 

" The Cat In The Hat " is mean-spirited toward the kids , and is even more mean-spirited toward the adults . 

The Walden children are surrounded by people who should never be their role models . 

Not one adult comes across as a sympathetic character . 

Joan should know better about Mrs. Kwan's propensity for napping , and Lawrence and Hank are absolutely obnoxious and selfish . 

The adults are not the least bit appealing . 

As for Myers , he has no chemistry with Fanning or Breslin , who are the best parts of this movie . 

He comes to the home not as the spirit of fun , but as the spirit of a stand-up comic . 

In fact , Myers changes his voice so many times , he seems like he's playing Robin Williams playing The Cat . 

The voice he adopts most often , though , sounds like Myers's Linda Richman character from " Saturday Night Live . " 

In fact , The Cat often uses skits to entertain , such as using an infomercial to get Sally and Conrad to get a device guaranteed to create a mess . 

He even needs a gadget to see what sort of fun is needed . 

The Cat should know this instinctively . 

The low point , though , comes when Sally , Conrad , and The Cat are on a slide , and Myers turns toward the camera and makes a shameless plug for the Universal Studios theme park . 

This feline doesn't show Sally and Conrad how to have fun ; he shows them how to be consumers . 

" The Cat In The Hat " marks the feature film debut of Bo Welch , best known in Hollywood as a production designer . 

The community in the film looks like a live variation of Seuss's vision , but that's about all that's faithful to his work . 

This film has no direction ; it's just a series of skits that just barely run long enough to constitute a feature-length film . 

There's exactly one funny moment in this poor excuse for a movie . 

When The Cat first enters , he finds a coat hanger , puts Mrs. Kwan on it , and throws her in the closet . 

" The Cat In The Hat " otherwise does not have any true sense of playfulness . 

The only ones who are playful at all are Fanning and Breslin . 

It's fun to watch Conrad try and convince the prim and proper Sally to bounce on their mother's couch . 

Unfortunately , they're the only ones who seem to understand what they're supposed to be doing . 

I get the feeling that if somebody had let these children direct the movie , they would have done better than Welch . 

I said this when the live-action " How The Grinch Stole Christmas " was released , and I'll say it again here . 

Don't introduce children to the work of Dr. Seuss with the live-action " The Cat In The Hat . " Read the books to them , or let them read the books to you . 

Catch up to the animated features Seuss and Chuck Jones helped to create . 

Mike Myers can claim he played The Cat In The Hat , but in reality , all he is is a pale imitation of a beloved children's character . 

Poor Dr. Seuss' , he must be rolling in his grave . 

This movie stank , stunk , stinks ... Mike Myers is a twit that obviously was suffering severely from being in that costume . 

His acting stank , stunk , stinks . 

This movie is NOT for young children , which is rather disappointing because thats who would have watched the movie had it been any good . 

Kids were asking their parents to leave , and parents were asking falling asleep during the flick . 

Sure the special effects were neat , I guess , if you are into those types of things . 

The jokes were not that funny . 

It was NOT worth the money paid . 

I should have waited until it came out on video and rented it for .99 cents . 

Better yet waited a few years until they played it on some hacked up cable channel . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot . 

Often touted as Americas Sweetheart , Julia Roberts has made some nice , lighthearted films like Pretty Woman , Steel Magnolias , Notting Hill , My Best Friends Wedding  and her Oscar-winning role in Erin Brokovich . 

Since winning the Oscar for Best Actress , Roberts went on a detour to experiment more as an actress , notably with independent filmmaker Steven Soderbergh , who she worked on Erin Brokovich  for films like Oceans Eleven , Full Frontal , and George Clooneys directorial debut for Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . 

Some wonder if Roberts  experiment would be a detour from Hollywood but she decided to return to her leading lady status for the all-prep school drama Mona Lisa Smile . 

Mona Lisa Smile  is about a 1953 subversive art teacher from UCLA who goes to the east coast , All-women School of Wellesley College to teach a group of overachieving students to find alternatives to marriage . 

Along the way , she has to endure the rigid , conservatism of the school , its students , and the façade society that is the 1950s . 

Directed by Mike Newell and written by the team of Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal , Mona Lisa Smile  might seem like the female version of Peter Weirs 1989 masterpiece Dead Poets Society . 

Apparently , it is nt nor should it even be compared to Dead Poets Society . 

Hailed as one of the most anticipated films of 2003 , Mona Lisa Smile  comes off as a bland , mediocre mesh of a film that leaves too many unanswered questions and contrived messages . 

Not even the films young cast of Kirsten Dunst , Ginnifer Goodwin , Julia Stiles , and Maggie Gyllenhaal along with Dominic West , John Slattery , and Marcia Gay Harden could save this disappointment called Mona Lisa Smile . 

The film begins when former UCLA teacher Katherine Watson ( Julia Roberts ) who arrives at the station for Wellesley College , an all-womens school in Massachusetts where shes been hired to teach in the art department for its students . 

Watson meets up with staff and lives in the house with fellow teacher , Nancy Abbey ( Marcia Gay Harden ) who has an affixation with TV show  I Love Lucy . 

On Watsons first day , she meets up with her class to show them slides of paintings and every student identify the painting as such like robots and Watson finds herself being challenged . 

She talks to Nancy and school nurse Amanda Armstrong ( Juliet Stevenson ) about the first day saying it was fine . 

The next day , Watson gives paintings that werent in the required syllabus for the students that leads to the schools news editor Betty Warren ( Kirsten Dunst ) to saying the painting is appalling since it has no structure or textures . 

Fellow classmates Constance Baker ( Ginnifer Goodwin ) and Giselle Levy ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ) however find something different about as Giselle considered it aggressive and erotic . 

Betty is nt fond of Watsons subversive tactics although the rest of her classmates including valedictorian Joan Brandwyn ( Julia Stiles ) find them refreshing . 

Giselle however , thinks Watson is great as she plays around a lot carrying a diaphragm around her that she got from the school nurse . 

Betty , being the snitch , writes about Armstrong giving out contraceptives that forced to be fired by the schools rigid , conservative president Jocelyn Carr ( Marian Seldes ) . 

Katherine finds herself in a dangerous position wondering if she should continue to challenge the system while finding a bit of sympathy from the schools Italian professor Bill Dunbar ( Dominic West ) . 

When Katherine was grading papers , she meets up with Joan who questioned her grade as Katherine just wants her to state her own opinion and not someone elses . 

Katherine asks what Joan plans to do , after marriage since shes already signed up for pre-law . 

Katherine suggests she should go to Yale . 

One event the school is anticipating is Bettys wedding to an important young named Spencer Jones ( Jordan Bridges ) as the whole school attends and it becomes some event as Giselle continues to flirt with Dunbar , whom she had an affair with in the summer . 

Joan and her boyfriend Tommy Donegal ( Topher Grace ) would visit Betty and Spencer on one occasion as she tells Betty that shes thinking of going to Yale Law School to Bettys utter disgust . 

Katherine meanwhile , is trying to teach the class more about art . 

Not to appreciate but look beneath the paintings , notably Jackson Pollock . 

The students find themselves more comfortable , including Constance who always gets some sort of bad criticism from Betty . 

Constance finds herself more at comfort whenever Betty is nt around , especially when pursuing aspiring writer Charlie Stewart ( Ebon Moss-Bacharach ) . 

When Betty returns from her honeymoon , she tries to make horrible comments towards Watsons abrasive tactics but Watson refuses . 

During the holidays , Katherine receives a visit from her boyfriend Paul Moore ( John Slattery ) who tries to propose to her but she finds herself uncomfortable , especially in the presence of Dunbar and Giselle . 

Joan meanwhile , is questioning on what she wants since she loves Tommy but also wants to be a lawyer . 

Katherine breaks up with Paul and finds herself more becoming closer to Dunbar . 

Dunbars newfound relationship with Watson leaves Giselle to be a bit more desperate as she tries to find a new affair . 

After a party where Katherine revealed that she was once engaged but never made it to the altar , Betty goes into another rant over Katherines life and finds herself alienated by the rest of the student . 

Betty becomes a thorn to some students , notably the insecure Constance as she tells her that Charlie had been going out with someone , which turned out not to be true as Betty finds her marriage crumbling . 

The political aspect of the school grows tense when the board question what Katherine has been doing . 

The students began to ponder their own direction in life including Betty as Katherine is wondering if she should stay without any sense of compromise . 

What makes Mona Lisa Smile  such a disappointing film in many levels is rooted in its script . 

The script leaves too many plot holes about why is Katherine being subversive , what emotional reasons is Giselle having for these affairs , why the school is trying to be protective of new things , and why is this script such a mess ? 

Then again , this is what should be expected from the likes of Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal since they wrote such awful films like the Planet of the Apes  and Mighty Joe Young  remakes . 

They leave too many characters with unanswered questions , rigid stereotypes ( in the male roles ) , generic film clichés including a very bland ending that leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth , and contrived messages that might upset the hardcore feminists . 

Director Mike Newell , known for his great work in Enchanted April  and Donnie Brasco does a somewhat , mediocre job although he can capture great dramatic moments , he does nt give anyone the idea on what type of film this should be . 

Should this be a drama , a comedy , a thinking film , what ? 

The film has no true , linear structure and leaves everything in a very disappointing way . 

Newell still should be given credit for trying to make things interesting since the pacing of the film is attentive but it s given a weak script with no sense of a singular direction to begin with . 

What was the point of this film ? 

I know women in the 1950s played these rigid , housewife roles that have a nice image but I doubt there was any sense of extreme until the Beat movement later in that decade . 

I know women were the core audience of this film , particularly young college women . 

Yes , it s all right with women to be married and to have a career . 

I dont have a problem with . 

I just dont like it presented in this bland , contrived form . 

One of the few positives of the film is the cinematography by Anastas N. Michos , that has lovely moments of colorful images and that authentic 1950s look . 

Even the production and costume designs are well used . 

Since the film was a period piece of sorts , you have to have that authentic look and back-in-time feel . 

While the cinematography , art direction , production designs , and costumes design should be noted , it still does nt have the freshness of what to expect for a film made for the Oscars , which is one huge reason why this film was made . 

Another noted factor but in a very poor way was the score by Rachel Portman . 

Even in the tense , dramatic moments , it does nt feel suspenseful nor in the lighter moments , it comes out as fluff . 

Julia Roberts without a doubt , is a good actress depending on what film she does . 

Unfortunately in period pieces like Mary Reilly  and Michael Collins , she has never fared well and in Mona Lisa Smile , she does nt really bring anything that we have nt seen before . 

Sure , her smile will make you go to the theaters but does it help the film . 

No . 

While she showed some masterful parts in the dramatic scenes and having some nice chemistry with Marcia Gay Harden , she does nt carry spark when it comes to the romantic scenes with Dominic West , which felt too fast and very clichéd . 

Wests character , like most of the male characters , is written in a very stereotypical way . 

Wests Bill Dunbar is served as this lothario who is nt quite as he seems and it s a very clichéd character and Wests performance is mediocre at best . 

The rest of the male performances from Topher Grace and Jordan Bridges are also clichéd although Grace does bring in some charm into his performance while Bridges just stands there and look good next to Kirsten Dunst . 

John Slatterys role as Roberts boyfriend was so underused and was left very early after she dumps him and he seemed like a good guy and it was a waste for Slattery . 

The best male performance goes to Ebon Moss-Bacharach as the nerd-like Charlie Stewart since he has a charm and his performance even surpasses the cliché his character is written and the scenes he has with Ginnifer Goodwin were nice to watch . 

While the smaller performances of Juliet Stevenson , Marian Seldes , and Donna Mitchell as Dunsts mother were used to a good degree despite their clichés while Mitchells character as this mean , controlling mother was a little too much . 

Kirsten Dunsts performance as the b*tchy Betty Warren at times is convincing since you dont like her but you dont really sympathize with her character very much at all and she comes out very shrilly . 

Even when she strays from her mother and conservative views , her development is way too fast and it ends up becoming a very mediocre performance . 

Julia Stiles  performance I found to be the most confusing because half the time , shes speaking in an English , New English , or a straightforward American accent . 

It was very messy and her character was just totally generic , I did nt really care for her . 

The films best performance for me goes to Ginnifer Goodwin as Constance since she was someone to sympathize with since she is nt the prettiest of the whole group but Goodwin plays her performance with a lot of heart . 

Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers an excellent performance although she is not the scene-stealer many are saying . 

Although I enjoyed her character in the film since she kind of played the big-sister role for other characters as well as being flirtatious , I felt the character was underwritten . 

In the films site , they say she is fragile and all of this junk yet I never found out why she sleeps with these men or anything . 

It was very confusing to be quite honest with although Gyllenhaal , to her credit stood out on her own . 

Marcia Gay Harden is the films most hilarious performance since she tries to teach the women how to please your husbands while having some sadness that she tries to hide through her humor . 

Harden , deserves a lot of credit for bringing him some much needed humor to the rigid , melodrama the film was going under . 

Overall , Mona Lisa Smile  is just a huge disappointing effort from Mike Newell despite some noteworthy performances from Marcia Gay Harden , Maggie Gyllenhaal , and Ginnifer Goodwin . 

It was very clear from the start this film was made to get some attention for the Oscars but after the recent snub from the Golden Globes ( except for Best Original Song for Elton John , which is an all right song ) ; it s likely not to get any Oscar nominations for anyone involved except the costume and production designs . 

Fans of Julia Roberts might enjoy this although they might expect more from her as an actress instead of the name people know . 

Fans of Gyllenhaal should best stay away from this film although she does a good performance . 

Mona Lisa Smile  is really a film for fans of Julia Roberts although many fans would feel it couldve been much better in the end . 

This is the worst movie I have seen in recent memory . 

A lot of people say , " This is a movie for kids , not adults , so don't be so harsh . " 

But even my kids ( 10 and 14 ) disliked it . 

It was " Austin Powers Does Dr. Seuss . " 

It was so bad , I can't even think of a way to make fun of it . 

The jokes were tired and WAY overdone . 

The attempts to insert humor for the parents was just painful and out of place . 

Despite what some people think , a kids movie can be good and appeal to adults , such as Toy Story or Space Jam . 

My wife is very forgiving when it comes to bad movies , and even she said she wouldn't be buying this one for our video library . 

What a truly awful adaptation from such a wonderful children's classic . 

So much could have been done with this classic story . 

Instead , the result is major disappointment , a poor attempt to mimic The Grinch ( which worked ) and other movies of this genre . 

Myers is a fish out of water , trying hard to liven-up an otherwise dreadful script and story line , and pandering to adults with "oh-so-current " references and innuendo . 

The mean-spirited character over-played by Alec Baldwin is enough to give nightmares to children familiar with his role as the benevolent Mr. Conductor in the Thomas the Tank Engine movie . 

Kelly Preston is gorgeous . 

I was insulted every time the two disturbed children were forced by the Director to "look at the camera , show astonishment , look at each other , then look back at the camera" . 

What a tremendous lost opportunity 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

One of these days I'm going to learn that ghost movies just don't scare me like they used to , and I should stop wasting my time on them in the theatres . 

I'm not sure if I just got over them , or if it's just because they are all the same . 

The Ring creeped me out , but lost me towards the end . 

Gothika was like a bad combination of several other movies , and I have yet to place what ones they were . 

Girl Interupted and The Ring , as well as Don't Say a Word are the first to pop into my mind , with slight residues of House on Haunted Hill and maybe even a little bit of The Sixth Sense 

Gothika is about Miranda Grey , a psychologist at a prison for women . 

The movie starts with a session with Chloe ( Penelope Cruz ) , a woman who had been raped by her stepfather and who had killed him . 

She is obviously quite disturbed , she keeps referring to the devil as the one who rapes her . 

The session ends with her being dragged out of the room , kicking and screaming . 

Dr. Grey obviously doesn't believe her . 

On her way home from work that evening , Dr. Grey is presented with a detour due to a sinkhole created by a rainstorm . 

The darkness and the pounding rain set the stage for what is about to happen next . 

She is crossing a covered bridge , and when she emerges at the other end , there is a girl standing there , in her nightgown , right in the middle of the road . 

She swerves , barely misses her , and goes into the ditch . 

Dr. Grey gets out of her car , limping , and confronts the girl , who is shaken and scared looking . 

The girl has scratches on her chest , and Dr. Grey immediately starts consoling her , telling her she will help her - then the girl explodes into flame , which covers Dr. Grey as well ... 

The next scene shows us a very disheveled Dr. Grey sitting bolt upright in bed , locked up in the prison where she works . 

She has no idea where she is or what has happened to her . 

She finds out that three days ago she had gone home and killed her husband ( Charles Dutton ) , who was also the'boss' at her place of work . 

Devastated , she sets out to find out how this could have happened . 

She has no memory of what happened , all she remembers is the girl . 

The bulk of the movie that follows involves a lot of "boo " scenes , as I call them - scenes that make you jump . 

This type of thing was really overdone . 

Well placed , these scenes can really add to a movie , but when there are too many you start to expect them and they lose their effect . 

I'd much rather have a movie that messes with your mind rather than tests your reflexes . 

There are a lot of creepy shots of the girl as a ghost , who seems to pop up randomly . 

At times it seems like the ghost is just playing with her , spooking her at the most inopportune of times ( even though I am sure this was unintentional ) . 

After a while , that starts to get old , after all , we have all seen this sort of thing before in other ghost movies . 

I'm not sure where it started , but I want to know why almost all ghosts in recent films walk strange , in a disjointed weird way . 

The first time I saw that it was creepy , but now it is practically cliche , and almost annoying . 

I don't know if I am giving anything away by saying this , but the whole "help the ghost find justice so they can rest in peace and leave me alone " thing is just getting old as well . 

I almost groaned when this theme popped up in the movie ( though I should have expected it ) . 

What I don't get is why ghosts in these situations completely terrorize the people they have chosen to help them . 

But of course , who am I to argue about the way a ghost reasons ? 

The climax of this film was a bit anticlimatic . 

I don't know if I was just fed up with the blabbermouths behind me , or if I really didn't care how the movie ended . 

The pieces just didn't seem to fit right , like they were parts from a different movie or something . 

The suspense in this movie could have been done a bit better . 

Some parts worked , most didn't . 

A lot of stuff was immediately obvious , and the'twists' weren't all that surprising . 

I didn't really notice the special effects : that means they were good enough that they didn't stand out - that's a good thing . 

I don't like it when the special effects are obvious - they should blend with the movie . 

There was one scene that could have been done a bit better , but overall the few times special effects needed to be used , they were done well . 

Despite the negativity about the movie , I do feel that Halle Berry did a really good job of playing the part of Dr. Grey . 

Penelope Cruz was also very good as the highly disturbed Chloe . 

Robert Downey Jr's character ( Pete Graham ) was a bit shallow , but I think that may have been intentional . 

Overall , this movie is probably worth seeing . 

I am left with an empty feeling where the creepiness should be after a good ghost story , so I'm a bit disappointed . 

This movie is rated R in the US , " for violence , brief language and nudity" . 

I don't remember any nudity ( well they were naked but it didn't show anything ! ) . 

In Canada it is rated A , which means you only have to be 14 to get in ( much to our dismay at the noise and rowdiness in the theatres ) . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot . 

The Gothic tradition of violent change enveloped in mystery and steeped in moody atmosphere is re-imagined by Hollywood in " Gothika" ...or so they want you to believe . 

Halle Berry plays criminal psychologist , Dr. Miranda Grey , whose stable life is turned up-side-down after an accident on a bridge during a dark and stormy night . 

She awakens , shocked to find herself incarcerated at the Woodward Penitentiary for Women , alongside the criminally insane patients she once treated . 

Unable to remember having committed an unmotivated act of such sheer brutality against a husband she loved and admired ( Charles S. Dutton ) . 

My first thought was : Don't most wives that murder their husbands wake up in jail first ? 

As poor Miranda tries to regain her memory and prove her innocence , she is untimely haunted by disturbing visions that further persuades evidence of madness by her former colleagues , like Dr. Pete Graham ( ROBERT DOWNEY JR. ) , Miranda's sympathetic but skeptical coworker who is wrestling with issues of his own - he is in love with Miranda . 

The visions in question concern a mysterious young woman shivering naked in the road during that dark and stormy night when Miranda's trouble began . 

These images are from a vengeful spirit in Miranda's mind , causing her to question many things about her own beliefs in psychology - such as , maybe the patients that say they are hearing voices really are hearing voices - and that perhaps she herself is possessed . 

In an ironic twist , we find Miranda's own treatment mirroring her old therapies used on dangerous patients such as Chloe ( Penelope Cruz ) , whose confessions of satanic torture were dismissed by the prude Miranda as ramblings . 

The problem with being crazy is that no matter what you say or how well you say it , they'll still think you're crazy . 

This would have been a welcoming topic to play upon even if it has been done before , but the moment comes and then it passes as a means to give the viewers an uneasy feeling . 

Halle as a criminal psychologist was not a believable job . 

She struggled on medical terminology and her character seemed unacquainted in her own environment . 

Miranda the patient was a more plausible impression , considering Halle Berry has a natural confused look on her face which enhances this role . 

The movie talks horror and fear but delivers none . 

The ambience has a natural feel for any " B" horror film , yet the actual scare tactics are implied by the storyline : The audience "needs " to be afraid for Miranda , but the writer and director assume we will be . 

Instead of walking us slowly through these moments , we are intended to use the totality of the movie as a "what if " scenario . 

- What if you were told that you did something terrible but you have no memory of doing it ? 

- 

That's not scary . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot . 

Anyone old enough to remember the TV series CIRCLE OF FEAR or NIGHT GALLERY ? 

They were mid-70s show in the vein of Rod Serling's TWILIGHT ZONE but the little episodes were very predictable and formula . 

Usually , someone was murdered and , usually , their ghost came back for revenge in a number of bizarre fashions . 

GOTHIKA is a throw-back to those old TV shows - a supernatural revenge story with state of the art special effects and some chilling cinematography that makes the movie look a lot classier than it deserves to be . 

Halle Berry , gorgeous and with a surprisingly good screaming voice , threatens to pull a Cuba Gooding Jr. with her post-Oscar career in this tepidly written horror movie with the inexplicable title . 

Berry plays Dr. Miranda Grey , a prison psychologist specializing in dealing with the criminally insane . 

Her primary patient , Chloe , played by the overrated Penelope Cruz , is a lisping example of over-acting . 

When Cruz screams some obscenities for effect and then tries to touch her doctor , she comes off as someone who's watched Isabella Rossellini in BLUE VELVET too many times . 

And she ain't no Rossellini . 

Intentionally or not , the beginning of GOTHIKA has Berry misequating professional distance and aloofness . 

While Cruz goes into yowling hysterics , Berry calmly walks down the prison hallway , heading for her daily swim( ! ! ) Miscasting abounds when Berry meets up with her creepy husband played by Charles Dutton and her creepy co-worker , the stalker-doctor played by Robert Downey Jr. 

Dr. Grey soon finds herself on the other side of the cell bars , accused of her husband's murder . 

Is she losing her sanity ? 

Is she guilty ? 

Are there ghosts at work ? 

The audience laughed when Downey described a patient's drug profile . 

Berry , obviously no student of ER , rattles off medical dialogue with all the conviction of reading her phone bill . 

She also doesn't seem to mind some blatant exploitation - there's a shower scene that seems to be there solely for some gratuitous nudity . 

But GOTHIKA's problems are multifold . 

Blame the director for not giving his all-star cast some instinctive direction . 

Blame the actors for not being interested in their characters . 

And blame the writer for a script that needed a rewrite or four . 

This is one of those whodunit horror movies that telegraphs its villains and victims well in advance . 

The true horror of GOTHIKA is that Halle Berry's choice of material is so hit and miss . 

Gothika is not a bad movie . 

The problem is that it's not a really good movie either . 

Its just another " thriller/mystery/ghost story " in a long line of nearly identical films . 

The acting is well done , and the cast is made almost entirely of top-notch actors . 

Halle Berry , one of the best high-profile actors in Hollywood , is able to take any role and make it work , and Penelope Cruz is outstanding in this movie . 

Robert Downey , Jr. , a man whose body of work I hold in much higher regard than his "brat pack " peers , remains consistently believable in Gothika as well . 

The problem is more the plot than anything else . 

It's all so overdone that it wasn't hard to nab every aspect of it long before they were revealed . 

I had a few problems with believability , and by that I don;t mean suspended disbelief . 

I will accept the supernatural within the context of nearly any film , and this is no exception . 

I simply can't buy the idea that Berry would be put into the very institution she worked for and placed under the care of not only her peers , but one of her closest friends . 

The effects and mood were done rather well . 

The entire theater gasped and jumped at one particular scene - which is always a good sign for this kind of movie . 

But the plot inconsistencies coupled with the fact that this movie beats a dead horse is enough to take away a few stars . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot . 

This was definitely "one to miss " the first time I saw the trailer . 

But you know what they say about curiosity and the cat . 

Mona Lisa Smile is what I guess you might call a " f*ck tradition " kind of movie . 

Katherine Watson ( Julia Roberts ) gets a job as an art history teacher at Wellesley College . 

But her students turn out to be a bit smarter than she was anticipating . 

So she changes her approach , and the class has a wonderful discussion about what art is ( or what it isn't ) and who is qualified to define it . 

Then Amanda Armstrong ( greatly played by an underused Juliet Stevenson ) , one of the school faculty , gets caught distributing contraceptives and she is fired . 

Just goes to show ya , you don't mess with the rules . 

Strangely enough , though , it is commonplace at that very same school for teachers to turn their heads when the girls miss classes because they got married . 

As far as story goes , this is about as close to a story as it gets . 

Ms. Watson is content with questions , the girls have nothing but answers . 

Ms. Watson is content with life as a process , the girls want to get to the destination . 

Ms. Watson wants to teach these girls to be " tomorrow's leaders , not their housewives " . 

But her students , four of whom we focus on in particular , have their own stories . 

Joan could get accepted to Yale , but she's not sure she wants to put off the "home life " where tradition would have her be . 

Betty gets married right away , and starts to miss classes , but things only get worse at home too . 

Giselle lives with a torrid past . 

And Constance is just trying to make friends . 

Julia Stiles ( Joan ) is easy on the eyes , even if she does act 10 years older than she is . 

Her accent was not too shabby . 

Meanwhile , the "other " Julia ( Roberts ) struts her usual stuff . 

She's not terrific , but not terrible either . 

I think she may just be having a little too much fun playing miserable roles ( falling on the ice comes to mind ) when in real life , she is anything but . 

But enough about that . 

Ginnifer Goodwin ( Constance ) was just a cute girl playing a cute sideplot . 

Kirsten Dunst ( Betty ) is just too damn pretty to be defiant . 

You don't want to see her upset ,'cause then you get upset yourself . 

She actually did a decent job b!tchin' it up here . 

I kinda liked her hair too . 

Speaking of hair , who knew Maggie Gyllenhaal ( Giselle ) had so much of it ? 

I thought that stuff was gonna avalanche right out into the auditorium . 

As always , Maggie is excellent . 

Purely natural , graceful and highly in tune with her surroundings . 

Watch out for her in the coming years ; she'll be dangerous . 

I'm not sure what exactly Mona Lisa Smile sets out to say , except that maybe nothing is as it seems . 

I think the old traditions were society's way of "protecting " women . 

So they could follow " tradition " or they can go their own way , but for most of the women in the movie , they end up miserable either way , unless they get rid of their guys . 

Julia Stiles does get a great speech in toward the end in which she basically plays the kettle calling the pot black in return . 

It's no better to blindly shun tradition than it is to blindly follow it . 

Something like that . 

So I wasn't really sure which side I was on by the end ! 

So I can't say the movie didn't make me think . 

On the other hand , I'm not sure what exactly I AM thinking . 

Recommended for females , intellectual people , modernists , Maggie Gyllenhaal fans , and those with a great deal of patience . 

Not me , though .

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot . 

Mona Lisa Smile is a deck stacked in Julia Roberts' favor . 

The movie's premise is that every girl in a certain 1950's women's college is biding her time until she's lucky enough to find a man to provide for her . 

In like a California breeze sweeps Berkeley graduate Katherine Watson ( Roberts ) , to blow the cobwebs off of these young girls' unused minds . 

No doubt there were many repressed women in the pre-feminist era , but were so many of them gathered in one particular place ? 

The girls at Wellesley College are Stepford Wives in training . 

They let men treat them brutishly ( no physical abuse , mind you--the women just aren't allowed to think for themselves ) . 

Or they drink lots of booze and smoke up a storm . 

Or they sit around at night , practicing being spinsters ( particularly Marcia Gay Harden in a really thankless role ) . 

In fact , the only role more thankless than Harden's is that of Kirsten Dunst , so charming in Spider-Man and such a prig here . 

As Betty Warren--the school's unhappily married , McCarthy-like reporter--the sole point of Dunst's character is to make everyone as miserable as she is . 

Warren really takes passive-aggressiveness to an ethereal level . 

But there are a lot of cracks in Katherine Watson's progressive thinking , too . 

First off , if she's such a smart thinker , why is Watson making time with a prof ( Dominic West ) who has a rep for sleeping with the students ? 

Secondly , there's the little speech that one of the students makes to Katherine near movie's end . 

In effect , the student says that since Katherine wants every woman to make a choice , she's made her choice to be a housewife , and what's wrong with that ? 

From the moviemakers' point of view , the speech is meant to be ironic , but it actually leaks the ugly little secret that radical feminists don't want to hear : Another woman's choice doesn't always agree with your own . 

Anyway , the movie gives its game away at about the halfway point , when the girls usher Katherine into their secret cult , just like in Dead Poets Society . 

How progressive can a feminist movie be when it's set in the'50s and yet steals its ideas from a lousy'80s men's movie ? 

Mona Lisa Smile is rated PG-13 for adult language and situations . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals everything about the movie''s plot . 

Premise - Tom Cruise stars as a frontier captain that's down on his life . 

So he tries to sell new Winchester rifles by shooting at people . 

He is recruited by the Emperor of Japan to fight against the rebellion of samurais . 

So Cruise trains the Japanese army , and they move out to battle against the samurais . 

As predicted from the previews , he then becomes a samurai himself , and then he fights against the emperor's army . 

Review - Don't let this movie fool you . 

I looks like an epic . 

It stars Tom Cruise . 

It's big , loud , and it looks great . 

It has beautiful scenery , awesome battles , and it's well-acted . 

But , deep down inside , this is no better than an Ed Wood film . 

So , why is this a bad film ? 

First , and most of all , it rips off other great films before it . 

There can be some ripping off , but this film goes overboard . 

Here's all the things I can point out : 

Glory- Remember the part in Glory when Broderick shouts : " Faster ! 

Faster ! " while training the black army for the North ? 

Tom Cruise , while training the Japanese , shouts : " Shoot me ! 

Shoot me ! Faster ! 

Faster ! " Also , Broderick shoots a gun a couple of time to scare the black man and make him nervous to simulate a real battle . 

Tom Cruise does the same thing . 

In Glory , after this ordeal , Broderick says : " Teach them properly . " 

Indicating that they are not ready . 

Tom Cruise says : " They are not ready . " 

Hmmm...Rip off ? 

I let this slide , but there is oh so much more . 

Cool Hand Luke- Remember when Paul Newman is fighting that big guy in the boxing match , and he won't give up , even though he knows he is defeated ? 

Well , in The Last Samurai , there is a scene EXACTLY like it ! ! Except , instead of boxing gloves , they're wooden swords . 

The Patriot- Mel Gibson's character is not proud of what he did to some French soldiers . 

Tom Cruise's character is not proud of what he did to some of the Native Americans . 

Dances With Wolves - Kevin Costner's character was an frontier man who then becomes like the Native Americans . 

He learns their ways , and learns to love them . 

Tom Cruise is a frontier man that becomes like the Samurai . 

He learns their ways , and learns to love them . 

The whole gripe I have is the fact that this movie shamelessly rips off so many more movies before it . 

Though I listed only 4 examples , I counted 10 when I first came out of the theater , but I can't think of the others . 

However , it rips off hundreds of characterizations from other movies and books . 

Other than the rip offs , I find it very funny how Tom Cruise , the all-mighty white man , it the only survivor of the entire Samurai army . 

I'm sorry , when thousands of bullets are flying right to you , you are going to get hit , and you are going to die- PERIOD . 

Also , the nightmares Tom Cruise had about killing the Native Americans never really comes into full focus . 

He seems to have just had these nightmares , but after these nightmares , these actions don't come in anywhere else in the movies . 

And he blames this one guy that led the attack for all this , and Cruise himself shot the natives without question . 

He didn't even really put up a good fight against his commander's orders . 

He doesn't even get tempted not to shoot . 

He just fires away . 

It could have been a great movie . 

It could have been excellent , and to all the people who have forgotten about the older , greater movies before it , will think that as well . 

It does have beautiful scenery , some of the best since Lord of the Rings . 

The acting is well done , and I really liked the son of the leader of the Samurai . 

He was a likeable chap , and I hated to see him die . 

But , other than all that , this movie is nothing more than hidden rip-offs . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot . 

I wish I hadn't seen this movie . 

I wish that Roger Ebert hadn't given it 3 out of 4 stars and said , this is one of those rare Christmas comedies that has a heart , a brain and a wicked sense of humor , and it charms the socks right off the mantelpiece . 

Did Roger and I see the same movie ? 

I'm thinking no because I walked out of that theater feeling like I had wasted 95 minutes of my time . 

I went in thinking gee , this is gonna be a neat movie . 

In truth , it was one of the worst ones I've seen this year . 

sigh 

Maybe my expectations were too high ? 

The Story 

Thirty years ago , Buddy ( Will Farrell ) is placed in an orphanage , waiting for some nice family to adopt him . 

Christmas Eve , after some nun puts him to bed , Santa Claus ( Ed Asner ) drops in to deliver gifts . 

Buddy , seeing a teddy bear peaking out from his sack , crawls out of his crib and into Santa's bag . 

Santa doesn't know that he's taken Buddy back to the North Pole until he crawls out of the bag in the Elves Workshop . 

What's a Santa to do ? Hand him over to Papa Elf ( Bob Newhart ) . 

Papa Elf does his best to raise little Buddy . 

The thing is , little Buddy isn't so little . 

Since he was a young boy , he's always towered over all of the other elves . 

After years of not fitting in , Papa Elf finally tells Buddy that he's adopted . 

His father Walter ( James Caan ) ( who doesn't know about Buddy ) lives in a magical place ( New York ) and his mother Susan ( Jane Bradbury ) died shortly after he was born . 

Buddy decides to move to the magical city and reunite with his father . 

Walter , who is on the naughty list , is a ruthless publisher by day and an inattentive father to Michael ( Daniel Tay ) and husband to Emily ( Mary Steenburgen ) by night . 

Buddy doesn't get the joyous reunion that he was expecting . 

For days , his father doesn't believe that he's his long , lost son . 

Walter , wanting to put this nonsense behind him , gets blood drawn from the both of them . 

His Dr. ( Jon Favreau ) confirms : It's a boy ! 

Not knowing what to do , he takes Buddy home to the family . 

His insistence on continuing his childish , elf behavior , rides on Walter's nerves . 

Can he accept his grown son ? 

Especially in his current altered elf state ? 

In other news , Buddy finds his way to Gimballs department store where he fits right in with the other help dressed as Christmas personnel . 

That's where he meets THE girl - Jovie ( Zooey Deschanel ) . 

He's immediately smitten with her but not because she has a hot body . 

Does Buddy gain the acceptance he's been craving from both his father and Jovie ? 

Believe me , you won't care . 

You'll be asking yourself , is there a way to leave this movie without offending my child and husband ? ? ? 

The Scoop 

Where to begin ? 

I used to have great love for Mr. Jon Favreau . 

After all , he is just a week younger than me and a fellow Libra . 

I loved him in Love and Sex . 

I adored him in Swingers . 

Of course in both of those circumstances , he was the actor and not the director . 

And maybe that's the issue . 

Maybe the man is meant to be an actor and not a director because if he stays on the directing path , he's surely headed for a disasterous career ending ... 

So what did he do wrong ? 

Let the list begin . 

First , Jon must think that if he chops a story up into a bunch of little skits , inserting a ton of physical comedy , then a movie will magically rise from it all . 

Presto! 

It's magic ! 

In the case of Elf , it's a mess . 

I kept on looking for a point to the story . 

The premise of it , written by David Berenbaum , was pretty blase to begin with . 

The only way Jon could have rescued it was to ensure that he had a capable set of actors along with a sentimental heart-beat running throughout , in order to keep the audience's attention . 

Second , the only time he seemed to elicit a laugh from the audience was when he resorted to using material that 8/9 year old boys laugh at . 

Farting - that was fun ( not ) . 

Eating gross things . 

Yep , that elicited a lot of laughter from the crowd ( but mostly the under 10 group ) . 

Second , could he have toned Will Farrell down a notch or two ? 

Or perhaps , could he have had Will act something other than a one-note whiner of an elf ? 

I don't think that I'll ever be able to watch SNL again for fear of a headache . 

So let's talk about Will Farrell . 

If he was playing my kid - as either a child or a full grown adult - I think that I would have to smack him . 

The way he played the character of Buddy wasn't what I was expecting . 

Instead of the wide-eye innocence that you get with other not so clued in movie characters ( think Tom Hanks in Big ) , what you get here is a one-track , annoying and irritating male . 

I kept on thinking - if Jon Faverau can't direct you , do something for yourself dude ! 

But he didn't . 

And that's so sad , too bad for him . 

Looks like Jack Black won the cross-over award for the year . 

Mary Steenburgen , Bob Newhart , Ed Asner , and the rest of the actors were fine enough . 

It's not like there was any Oscar-stretching material that they were having to deal with . 

They were merely background scenery to the Will Farrell show . 

And to top it all off , there was no memorable soundtrack . 

C'mon now . 

Christmas music is so easy and it's plentiful ! 

I know that as the credits rolled , I saw songs by Ella Fitzgerald and Lena Horne but hey - I must have totally zoned those out . 

Here's the bottom line . 

The movie had no heart . 

There was nothing present that made me care for the story or for any of the characters . 

No heart=the inability for me to overlook the mistakes made by Jon Favreau's poor directing . 

The End 

Elf is rated PG for some mild rude humor and language . 

Your 6-9 year old will probably laugh more than you . 

How pathetic is that ? ! 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

Ok let me get this out of the way : I did NOT like this movie . 

Borderline hated it . 

Now if you are only after positive reviews , then you might skip this , but if you are interested in why I thought it sucked , read on . 

To begin with , I only mildly like Will Ferrell . 

I don't think hes funny at all on SNL , but I was willing to give him a chance . 

I had seen previews for this a few weeks before it came out and it looked interesting , so I figured I would give it a shot . 

I'm very thankful that a local theater gives military discounts , I only paid $ 5.50 to see it , and after watching the movie , I feel like I COMPLETELY WASTED my money . 

It's a 100 % kids movie . 

There is ZERO bad language in it . 

The special effects and props are EXTREMELY low budget and so fake its not even funny . 

You can clearly tell what parts were filmed on a sound stage , as the backgrounds are blatently fake , no effort was put into them . 

Will Ferrell plays Buddy , an adult elf . 

The whole plot is basically that he snuck into Santas toy bag as a baby , wound up at the north pole , and was raised by elves . 

He comes to find out he has a father , played by James Caan , and goes on a journey to New York in search of him . 

That's the entire plot right there . 

I'm not going to bother spelling out what happens in the movie because enough people mentioned it already . 

The purpose of my review is for adults that think its a comedy and want to check it out . 

I regret ever seeing it . 

Almost every "funny " part is in the previews . 

Here are the funny parts : he drinks an entire 2 liter of coke and lets out a 30 second ( or so ) belch ; a scene where he tries to put a star on top of the christmas tree and it comes crashing down on him ; he attacks a fake Santa at a store because its not the real Santa . 

Yep , there you have it , those are the funny parts . 

No really , stop laughing . 

There is no bad language at all , nothing derogatory , no put downs , nothing sexual . 

I'm actually surprised Disney didn't make this movie since Disney movies aren't funny and geared towards kids . 

The plot is pathetically weak and totally predictable . 

It's one of those Ernest Saves Christmas type movies . 

After watching this flick , I will never watch Will Ferrell again . 

He's just NOT funny . 

In fact , if I were him , I would be ashamed of myself for signing such a horrible contract and agreeing to make a lame movie like this . 

Ok ... so anything positive about this movie ? 

No , not really . 

Actors are brain dead , rely on childish type humor to make the audience laugh , and you don't do a very good job convincing the audience even for a moment that this is a fantasy flick . 

I'm sure children would like it , as its geared strictly for them . 

Adults who like clean humor and Disney type not funny movies will probably like this . 

It's a completely disconnect the brain , plan on wasting some money and a few hours of your life , and go see it . 

I don't recommend this to anybody looking for a serious laugh , or even a little bad language . 

Obviously this is just my opinion , I don't expect others to feel this way , but if you like adult humor , decent acting , a movie with a plot , and a believeable movie set , then avoid this movie like the plague . 

If you have seen it and disagree with me , to each his own . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

There's a big hole at the center of Elf , and his name is Will Ferrell . 

The movie's premise is that Santa Claus ( Ed Asner ) accidentally hijacks a baby to the North Pole . 

The baby is named Buddy ( played by Ferrell ) and raised by a senior elf ( Bob Newhart ) as one of the North Pole's own . 

Eventually , Buddy is sent back to his home town of New York to find his biological father ( James Caan ) . 

The opening scenes are a letter-perfect take-off on the Rankin-Bass Christmas TV specials . 

And Newhart's straight-to-the-camera , deadpan narration sets the perfect tone . 

But as soon as Buddy hits Manhattan , the movie starts going awry . 

There are many scenes of broad physical comedy where Buddy is overawed by modern life and misinterprets people's commands to him . 

If ever there was a pregnant premise for comedy , a naive , six-foot-tall elf set loose in unforgiving New York City ought to be it . 

But Will Ferrell is not the man for the job . 

Steve Martin and Jim Carrey have the wild abandon for this kind of thing , and heaven knows what elfin Robin Williams would have done with the role . 

But Ferrell , another of those " Saturday Night Live " vets who go for nothing beyond the quick laugh , can't milk a routine to save his life . 

And while everyone else in the movie seems sincerely committed to the story's potential sweetness , Ferrell's elf is little more than a variation on his "SNL " old routine as a hyperactive male cheerleader . 

Elf is inoffensive enough , and kids will probably lap it up . 

But even the children at the preview audience seemed more grossed out than cheered by some of the movie's Ferrelly Bros.-like humor , such as Buddy re-chewing discarded bubble gum or pouring maple syrup on everything he eats . 

If you're a discriminating adult , Elf probably won't be much more palatable . 

Elf is rated PG for minor adult language and references . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

Of all the cartoon classics that made themselves a daily routine during those sweltering summer vacations in Jacksonville , The Cat In The Hat ranks as possibly THE one that I watched the most . 

If machines could think , that VCR probably would have dealt me a few spankings of its own . 

I felt mostly ambivalent toward 2001's The Grinch . 

While I liked what they did , it just wasn't the same . 

With The Cat In The Hat , it's mostly more of the same . 

But I hesitate to have too much faith in my own intolerably inane skills as a critic , because how do you know when exactly you're crossing the line between saying that the movie blows and saying that growing up blows ? 

Maybe that's all it is . 

I'll tell you this much -- I laughed . 

I had a good time . 

There were loads of one-liners , funny faces , pranks , and even a few brushes with vulgarity ( none of which would compel me to deprive my own kids of the pleasure , had I any ) . 

The atmosphere was right on target , even if much happens outside the house itself . 

There's difference number one . 

The differences between the new and the old go on for miles . 

Foremost among them is the plot , and in second place is a whole lot of character conflict . 

But let's start with the plot , shall we ? 

In the original , it was all about trying to find that moss-covered three handled family gredunza . 

The cat busted in the house all angry , the kids just looked at each other like " What ? " Remember that scary music that played ? 

Here , it goes completely the other way . 

The Cat appears out of nowhere and the kids run away screaming . 

Then , they just start having fun . 

That's basically it , except for some line of bologna about showing the boy ( Spencer Breslin ) how bad it is to make a mess . . by making a bigger one , and showing the girl ( Dakota Fanning ) how not to be so uptight . 

( Deja vu , anyone ? ) 

In the original , the fish was THE antagonist . 

He was actually a frustrating character to watch , and when he was finally converted via a little language lesson ( a gato in a sombrero , you say ? ) , it was such a great moment ! 

Here , he is just another victim of the haphazard shenanigans , or worse yet , a reminder of how much better Finding Nemo was . 

Closest thing to an antagonist here is a next-door neighbor who is trying to impress the kids' mother by looking like a rich guy , but actually has false teeth and a beer gut , and sits in his house watching you-know-what . 

No kidding . 

Even more outlandish is his unsubstantiated obsession with disposing of the son by sending him off to military school . 

Dylan was right , the times they are a changin' . 

One of my favorite parts of the original was when they went on the big scavenger hunt for the moss-covered three handled family gredunza , and they have to mark all the places where it isn't . 

It isn't in this keyhole ( No ? ) and it isn't on my knee ( Hmm , mark the keyhole K-300 , mark the knee 57-G! ) Okay , it's a little sad that I still remember that . 

But I was saddened that they couldn't have found a way to at least incorporate this into the new one . 

Or how about " Nobody Loves Me " ? 

As if this all were not enough , the mystery surrounding the mother has been completely uncloaked . 

She's a legally blonde ... something , I don't remember ( my bad ! ) and she is hosting a party at her house that night . 

If it's not clean , she will be fired , because her boss has verminophobia . 

How perfect is that ? 

Couldn't they just have gotten the house clean for the sake of having it clean ? 

Why do we need an elaborate backstory to it ? 

Thing 1 and Thing 2 are only there because they have to be . 

And not to hit below the belt or anything , but they looked absolutely frightening ! 

Humor these days has become so random . 

I think it's almost gotten to a point where " the more absurd , the better " . 

There are traces of toilet humor , situational humor , irony , exaggeration , sarcasm and all that jazz . 

Chances are you're going to laugh more than a few times . 

But you may groan as much . 

As far as songs go , the Cat himself got to sing and dance , and he was quite the wire jumper . 

But oftentime , it went by so fast that you could barely tell what he was saying . 

I don't know how much Smash Mouth paid ( or got paid ) to have 1/3 of their album played behind this thing either , but it must've been a pretty penny ! 

Acting ? Don't ask . 

This is the stuff of third-grade school plays . 

Which , as I always say , is probably the whole idea . 

But I'll say this much -- Sean Hayes playing the Mom's boss makes the wildest Jim Carrey look like a sane individual . 

His character is utterly SMACKED out of his mind . 

Sean's "moment " near the beginning was one of my biggest laughs . 

Don't know if the same will hold true for you folks , probably not ! 

Bottom line , don't be a rule breaker . 

Above all else , Keep It Simple Stupid ! 

Oh , but how funny is it that I should bring up KISS while talking about this movie ! 

You know what I'm about to say ... 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot . 

I'll be the first to admit that I was never a big fan of Dr. Seuss's , Cat In The Hat . 

My speed was more , In A People House and Green Eggs and Ham . 

When Ron Howard and Brian Grazer announced that they were moving forward with a Cat In The Hat movie , I wasn't expecting much . 

After all , The Grinch , also based upon a Dr. Seuss book , had a lot of flash , but not much substance . 

So why did I go ? 

My nine year old loved the trailers and hey - who can say no to a nine year old ? 

Off we went , braving the crowds of snotty-nosed kids , and stressed-out looking parents ... 

I assume you're familiar with the book so I won't rehash the entire plot...The movie loosely follows the book , taking lots of modern day liberties . 

The " Mom " ( Kelly Preston ) is a single parent to Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) and Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) . 

By day , she works at Humberfloob Real Estate for the meticulously , germ-free , Mr. Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes ) . 

By night , she allegedly dates next door neighbor , Quinn ( Alec Baldwin ) . 

Conrad is your typical adolescent male . 

Always getting himself into trouble . 

Always harassing his sister . 

Always trashing the house . 

Sally is your typical good girl . 

She makes lists of things to do on her electronic organizer ( Make today's to do list , Be spontaneous , Research graduate schools ) . 

One day , their usual babysitter is unable to stay with them and Mom must find a replacement . 

Before returning to work , she specifically tells Conrad and Sally that they are not to step a foot into the living room , or else . 

You see , she's throwing a very important party that night for work and the last time she did this , her house was a mess and her neat-freak boss was on the verge of firing her for it . 

After mom leaves , the kids sit at the window , watching the rain poor down . 

A noise interrupts their boredom and when they go to investigate , they find the Cat ( Mike Myers ) . 

After getting over their initial fears , they soon realize that the Cat is here to make their lives fun . 

Fun ! 

Too bad fun includes loosing the dog , trashing the house , and getting the kids in trouble with Quinn . 

And that's enough of the story . 

I think this is also where I tell you ...and by this point in the movie , I was ready to leave ... 

So what went wrong ? 

The list is long , but distinguished . 

First , every good part of the movie was featured in the trailers . 

That sucked . 

I can only venture that Universal Studios saw the movie , figured out how bad it was , but then patted themselves on the back for being able to pluck out three minutes of decent material . 

For shame ... 

Second , Mike Myers , who I normally adore , ran amuck with his one-person SNL skits . 

While those work in small , contained areas , or in less traditional stories like Austin Powers , he picked the wrong character to take off the beaten path . 

I was disappointed in him however , my real anger has been turned to the director , Bo Welch 

Who is this guy Bo Welch and why did Brian Grazer allow him to direct a multi-bazillion dollar movie ? 

What , his buddy Ron Howard wasn't available ? 

What about the three million other directors who could have turned this picture into something salvageable ? 

Here was Bo's biggest issue . 

He seemed to be overwhelmed by the Dr. Seuss legend . 

He seemed to be afraid to do different things to endear us to the characters . 

Instead , he let Mike Myers run amuck . 

Third , can we talk about the non-chemistry of Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin ? 

Besides phoning in their performances , they seemed to have no real love for each other . 

Perfect strangers have more chemistry than these two . 

Fourth , does Alec Baldwin THINK that he's funny ? 

I've got news for him . 

He's not . 

I look at him and think , get a haircut . 

Fifth , who picked the music ? 

And most importantly , why in the hell would you have Mike Myers sing ? 

Ewww...the selections were horrible , not to mention the fact that the tunes stuck out like sore thumbs . 

Sixth , whoever was responsible for the special effects needs to enroll themselves in the Pixar school of creativity . 

There were several , obvious glitches and mistakes ( that should have been handled in editing but were not ) . 

Overlooking the errors , anyone - especially Grazer or Welch - thinking that the special effects could carry the movie are obviously deluded and should seek strong medication immediately . 

Seventh , the ever-wonderful Sean Hayes , who also does the voice of the fish , was relegated to a minor supporting role which sucked because his character had the opportunity to take this movie in a worthy direction . 

But oh no . 

Mr. Director must not be able to deal with animated characters ... 

Now Kelly Preston didn't offend me , so I guess you can say that this was the most redeeming part of the movie . 

Cat In The Hat is rated PG for mild crude humor and some double ententres . 

Personally , I can think of better things to do with your time than taking your kids to see this movie . 

Get a pedicure . 

Clean out your attic . 

Take a nap . 

All much more worthy of your time ... I promise . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot . 

After having heard so many positive reviews of the movie Elf , including a recommendation by one of the people I work with who only goes to the movie once a year on Thanksgiving , we decided to take the kids to see it on a rainy Friday afternoon in New York . 

The film begins with Pap Elf ( Bob Newhart ) relating just how Buddy  managed to come to live with the other elves in Santas workshop at the North Pole . 

Poor Buddy was abandoned to an orphanage and never knew his real parents . 

He crawled into Santas bag while Santa ( Ed Asner ) was chowing down on the milk and cookies . 

For some reason , Santa failed to notice his presence until they arrived back at the North Pole and Buddy crawled out of the bag . 

Buddy ( Will Ferrell ) stays with them , but there are problems . 

Hes twice the size of the other elves . 

He is nt capable of building toys with the same lightning-fast speed as the other elves ( must be something genetic ) . 

Finally , he has a heart-to-heart with Pap Elf who tells him all about his mother who put him up for adoption and passed away , and his father , who live in New York as a book publisher . 

Oh , and hes on the naughty list . 

The rest of the story involves Buddys quest to find his family in New York . 

He finds his father , Walter Hobbs ( James Caan ) working in the Empire State Building , and discovers hes married with another son . 

Walter was an interesting character . 

He did nt seem to be a bad guy , just someone who managed to get off track in life as his main focus became dollar signs and not being happy with his life . 

There are many people out there like this who go into one profession or another ( in Walters case , publishing childrens books ) because of their initial fondness for the work , and end up obsessed with the financial aspect . 

This what how the character of Walter Hobbs struck me . 

Buddy may not have been the perfect elf , but hes picked up some amazing talents and abilities from being around them . 

When he and his brother , Michael ( Daniel Tey ) are being chased by bullies through Central Park , Buddy manages to create a whole armload of snowballs in the time it takes Michael to create one . 

He can write a note on an Etch-a-Sketch faster than most people can on a pad . 

Most of the really funny moments of the film comes as Buddy tries to adapt to the real world . 

When he hears Santa will be arriving at Gimbels ( a department store that s been out of business for quite some time , by the way ) , he makes all sorts of preparations in the toy department for him imminent arrival , only to be shocked when it s an imposter . 

When he tries to go to work with his father , he is sent to the mail-room , where he befriends a man on parole who is something of a slacker , and together they turn the mail-room upside-down . 

There are also some truly humorous moments as it s shown that Buddy is so out of place in the elf world . 

I dont know how it was done , but Bob Newhart was half the size of Will Ferrell , so this made for some pretty humorous situations . 

There were also pictures of Buddy playing basketball with his fellow elves ( he looks bigger than Shaq ) . 

Theres not much really in the way of gross-out humor , which was something I really appreciated . 

Buddy eats some pretty strange combinations of food , and indulges in maple syrup on just about everything , along with finding  gum in some pretty odd places , but that s about it . 

The one bodily-noise humor comes after he chugs a full 2-liter of soda , but my feelings of dread that this was going to take a downturn in the humor department after this were not founded . 

Will Ferrell captures Buddys essence perfectly . 

Hes got a child-like innocence as he wanders around the city and has no real idea of the consequences of his actions at times . 

Ferrell plays Buddy perfectly - I did nt see him as dumb , only innocent and naive . 

His expressions of wide-eyed innocence at the events going on around him are also near-perfect , and not exaggerated nor over-done . 

I credit director Jon Favreau for a lot of this . 

The film could have easily descended into being a farce , but he kept it in line . 

The only bad point I came across was the ending which felt a bit too much like a rip-off of the ending to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer , but the kids really enjoyed it . 

Zooey Deschanel is Buddys love interest , a worker at Gimbels named Jovie . 

She seems alone in the big city  and for Buddy , it s love at first sight , although it takes a while for his Christmas spirit to rub off on the dispirited Jovie . 

Still , it s Jovie who on their first date takes him to see the largest Christmas tree of all . 

For me , that was the real star of the movie . 

I love going into New York City at Christmastime and walking around to see all of the decorations . 

The movie captures the store windows with their Holiday displays , the beauty of Rockefeller Center , and the decorations in some of the out-of-the way places . 

This film should do a lot for NYC tourism during the holiday period . 

While the film raptly kept my 8-year-olds interest , my 3-year-old was not impressed at all . 

It failed to capture his attention as many of the animated films do , and he fell asleep in my arms near the end . 

Although the film is rated PG , other than one friggin  and perhaps the burping scene and Buddys gum harvest , there was little that I could see that parents could complain about . 

It's also a good film if your kids still believe in Santa or are at the cusp where they are starting to have doubts , much like The Santa Clause was for my older daughter ( who opted to hang out with her friends rather than go to the theater with us - her loss ) . 

This is a fun film for the whole family to enjoy this holiday season . 

Its got some terrific laughs . 

Im not a Will Ferrell fan at all , but I did enjoy this movie . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

Christmas seems to be arriving earlier every year . 

Halloween and Thanksgiving are now the forgotten holidays as stores and businesses strum up garland and other holiday decorations in order to prepare for the hopefully fruitful shopping season ahead . 

The movie industry must be thinking the same thing starting this year especially after the success of last years The Santa Clause 2 , which opened the first weekend of November to nearly $ 30 million . 

New Line offers up their pre-holiday treat entitled Elf , which features the former Saturday Night Live comedian Will Ferrell , who has recently become a new rising star in Hollywood . 

After the dismal first half of the year with flops like A Man Apart and The Real Cancun , the studio bounced back in the second half with Freddy vs. Jason , Secondhand Lions , and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and hopes to continue the trend until their mega-success The Return of the King opens near Christmas . 

Can Elf do that ? 

If it s anything like The Santa Clause 2 , it easily could but the Ferrells comedy faces a lot more competition then Allens did . 

Not only does the film open up against The Matrix Revolutions , the yuletide feature goes head to head with the highly publicized The Cat in the Hat and Disneys The Haunted Mansion later this month . 

Until then the film will have to build up pretty good word of mouth for it to still hear cash registers ringing come Christmas Day , let alone Thanksgiving . 

The story focuses a larger then usual elf who learns he is actually a human and travels to New York City to find his father . 

Up at the North Pole , elves are busy getting ready for Christmas but there is one elf that is learning that he does nt quite fit in . 

Buddy is not the typical elf , his large size being the biggest factor . 

He eventually finds out from his adoptive father that he is actually a human that as an orphan baby climbed into Santas gift bag one Christmas Eve and found his way to Santas Workshop . 

After learning his true origin , Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and be part of a real family . 

But this is easier said then done as his father is a real Scrooge and is prominently found on the naughty list . 

Buddy , who has never been to the human world , is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that dont include sugar . 

The unusually happy elf must find a way to change his fathers workaholic attitude and help his new family find the true Christmas spirit . 

The story for Elf , though on the predictable side especially as the feature starts to wind down , works surprisingly well . 

This happens mostly in part to Ferrells performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even without the lead star . 

Though the feature does nt have an exceptionally large cast , the film does nt have to with some lead characters picking up any slack left over by that . 

Will Ferrell , who was featured earlier this year in the hit comedy Old School , once again proves he has as much comedic timing and talent as he ever did on Saturday Night Live and probably even more so . 

Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious without pushing the personality of the character too far as to make him annoying and pathetic . 

James Caan , who takes on the role of Buddys real father , has the grizzly workaholic business man down pat . 

The only problem lied not with Caans performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience . 

And a big highlight came from the performance of legendary comedian Bob Newhart as Buddys adoptive father . 

Newhart looks like he had a lot of fun with this role and gives a delightful performance that many will remember despite being only a supporting character rather then a lead . 

Overall , Elf joins the ranks of such holiday features as The Santa Clause and Dr. Seuss  How the Grinch Stole Christmas that shows Hollywood is still able to make a yuletide classic as good as the old days . 

Its the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrells exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy without one member of the family being alienated by certain material . 

There are relatively few complaints that can be made about comedy . 

The only one that is prominent in most minds would be that film tends to be bit predictable at the end of the feature but the filmmakers pull it off so well that many write it off and they should . 

The slightly-predictable ending should nt ruin the overall amusement and delightfulness that the rest of the film presented up to that point . 

Ferrells over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if you are not truly convinced , here may be a better reason : Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping . 

Smart , huh ? ! 

Elf is the story of a human who wandered into Santa's bag of toys while he was visitng a orphanage ( Will Ferrell ) . 

He then grows up to realize that he is not an elf , and ventures out into the real world to find his father ( James Caan ) . 

He finds him , and at first is not accepted . 

However , their relationship grows throughout the movie and it a great story , with humor for all ages . 

Ferrell's comedy , both physical and witty , is enough to make you fall out of your seat , even if you are sitting on the floor . 

The situations he gets himself into by his curiousity and naiveness are endless . 

And the irony of those situations is hilarious . 

I can remember at least 10-15 distinct times when the whole audience sitting in the theatre laughed out loud . 

Although a comedy , this movie does have some touching moments . 

Heck , it made me cry . 

Not really cry like big time , but a tear did roll down my cheek , in more than one place . 

The funny thing is , it was two different emotions . 

One was sadness , and the other was happiness . 

Weird , isn't it ? 

Anyway , I give this movie a great rating for its ability to play with my emotions . 

Laughter , happiness , sadness , and , yes , even guilt , played into my movie-watching experience when I payed my 9 dollars to watch Elf . 

Great movie . 

From Saturday night live to Old School and now to a even better and funnier movie ...ELF. 

Will Farrel plays the role of Buddy which is an unusual elf . 

An elf that is bigger than usual , has a lower voice that the rest , and is missing the pointy ears . 

This movie is a very good family movie not just because it's about Christmas but because it has a good message to it . 

The message that some people have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas and have given up on Santa . 

Well this is a movie that you would want to see to bring back that Christmas cheer . 

I have seen this movie twice now and can never stop laughing at Buddy's( Will Farrel ) actions to the city . 

I really enjoy how Will can make a movie without using adult humor . 

I only have one bad thing to say about this movie ... I really don't like the angry elf . 

Come join Buddy on his quest to find his father . 

As an actor , Will Ferrell shows promise for hilarious movies , thus I am driven to see them . 

From the previews alone , I have been dying waiting for elf to come out . 

I found it to be hysterical , as well as touching . 

My boyfriend doesn't even like Christmas and told me he had goosebumps for the last 20 minutes of the movie . 

Is there a lesson to be learned ? 

Does it matter ? 

Christmas is about feel-good movies and when do you feel better then when you are laughing 

Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot . 

Sometimes , the problem with writing a review is just knowing whom youre writing it for . 

Thats because your target audience is an important consideration when youre recording your impressions on any given product . 

Do they have the same taste as you ? 

Will they at least be able to understand your analysis and critique ? 

Any reviewer has his or her own biases , after all . 

Its important for a reader to identify this , and then take any advice in a review accordingly . 

So whats the point of all this in relation the Universal Pictures  The Cat in the Hat ? Were getting there , so please be patient . 

Admittedly , Universal has been plastering the airwaves with a steady barrage of commercials for this flick . 

Theyve also marketed it to the max , and Cat in the Hat merchandise is to be seen lately just about everywhere you go . 

Now that the film has been released , however , it has been generally panned by the professional critics , and more than a few Epinions reviewers seem to have had similar impressions . 

Theres just one problem with this that I can see . 

Above all , this is a childrens film ( though some adults will enjoy it ) . 

So what is the problem ? 

The children arent writing the reviews . 

That said , I thought I would attempt to take a kids perspective into view in writing my own review . 

But before all of that , let it be known that The Cat in the Hat is loosely based on Dr. Seuss childrens story of the same name . 

That story was not an exceedingly long one , so as you can imagine the film has been extended quite a bit with original material in order to make it a feature length film . 

Even at that , it s only about 82 minutes , rather brief indeed by todays standards . 

The action follows little Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) and Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) who live with their mom in a house like any other in the quaint town of Annville . 

As with any kids , Sally and Conrad have their own little idiosyncrasies . 

Conrad just loves to break the rules , and to do the opposite of whatever hes told . 

Sally , by contrast , is quite the opposite . 

Shes a stickler for being organized , prim and proper , so much so that it has cost her her friends . 

Enter mom Joan ( Kelly Preston ) . 

Shes involved with the guy next door ( Alec Baldwin ) , who cant stand the kids , and is trying to convince Joan to place Conrad in military school . 

Joan is torn on what to do , and to add to her problems her retentive boss Mr. Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes ) wants to host an important company party at her home . 

Which must be , of course , spotless , dooming the kids to a rainy day of boredom . 

To keep the house clean , theyre restricted as to what they can do . 

Until , that is , a mysterious six-foot tall talking cat in a magical hat ( Mike Myers ) arrives and changes all the rules . 

And that s how the fun begins . 

And the movie is fun . 

Admittedly , Myers does at times fall flat more than a few times with lines that just arent that funny . 

But more often than not , hes very funny , and at times hilarious . 

His interaction with Sally and Conrad are well executed , and both Fanning and Breslin give adequate performances . 

Make no mistake , neither one is as charming as , say , McCauley Culkin in Home Alone or Uncle Buck , but they are convincing enough in their roles for the film to work . 

Kelly Preston has little to do and not much time to do it in . 

Baldwin , however , is a convincing bad guy . 

Its fun watching him go down . 

Sean Hayes is also a lot of fun in his brief appearances as Humberfloob . 

Much of the magic of the film , however , is the fantastic world imagined by Seuss and brought to life on the big screen . 

The sets are delightful , as are the amazing characters Thing One and Thing Two . 

The special effects that bring them and their amazing antics to life are a lot of fun indeed . 

With a stretched plot and at times juvenile humor level , this film wont appeal to all adults . 

I laughed a lot and enjoyed it , but for many it may be best to wait for this one to hit the DVD shelves . 

But how about kids ? 

How do they like it ? 

This is , after all , a childrens story . 

When we attended , the kids in the audience seemed magically enthralled , eyes fixed on the screen throughout the film and with nary a sound escaping their lips except for the frequent fits of laughter . 

Kids 11 and under will likely love the film . 

There are a few moments of implied adult humor , but theyre mild and theres nothing that kids will really pick up on . 

At the end of the film , kids were calling the Cat cool , although Thing One and Thing Two seemed to get more praise than the Cat himself did . 

The film seemed to be very popular , and I think its rather brief running time is perfectly suited for younger ( and shorter ) attention spans . 

There's even a bit of a moral at the end as the youngsters learn something about themselves through their experiences with the Cat . 

Ill reiterate . 

The Cat in the Hat is a childrens film above all else , and when judged on that criteria it s a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with your youngsters . 

Dont expect more from it , and you may even enjoy the film along with them , as I did . 

This movie portrays the the children's story " The Cat in the Hat " in a very colorful and original manner . 

The children are adorable and the cat is very amusing . 

I especially enjoyed thing one and thing two , with their over the wall antics . 

This is a truly original movie , which brings a cartoon to life . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals no details about the movie''s plot . 

I drag my friends to see Gothika , why ? 

Because I am a person who loves horror films--all types and the previews looked enticing enough . 

So off we went to see the film , and overall , I was impressed . 

The videography of the film was great . 

Camera direction , eery set , but I think what made this film was the music . 

Yes , believe it or not , had the music not been suspenseful and skillfully placed at scenes where the audience got tense , then this film would have been a flop . 

The music added such intensity , it was similar to what made Friday the 13th films memorable . 

Another thing that was great was the acting . 

Well , I am usually never disappointed with Halle's acting , she is extremely good . 

But I was quite shock to see her play such a role that was different that her usual roles . 

It was great ! 

She fell so many times during the movie that I know realize how she broke her arm on the set . 

What was not so great about the movie was that there were gaps in the plot . 

I would like to see more character establishment . 

Plus , the role that Downey Jr. played was a little unclear--was he an obstacle or not ? 

Also , how did Halle get off from murdering a man ? 

These questions were not really answered . 

The idea of the film is not new either . 

It was like a different version of the Sixth Sense , but in a more perverse way . 

However , I forgive that because it seemed to work out at the end . 

Overall , I would recommend this movie to people who loves to go out on dates , because if she is as squeamish as I , you will be in for a treat . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

Let's start at the beginning . 

I adore Disney's Haunted Mansion in the Orlando theme park . 

It is for everybody . 

It is funny/scary , and as Disney caters to CHILDREN , all is as it should be . 

Things are themed to death , ghosts , and the supernatural in a very fun and creative climate . 

Beginning with " no windows and no doors , " you are sucked right into the spirit of the house - moving doors , talking head in a crystal ball , hearse with skeleton horse attached , tombstones with funny saying on it . 

The ride is absolutely very well done ! 

I see something new every time I take the ride and I've done it well over 12 times . 

Okay - now let's translate that thought into a movie ! 

What a fantastic idea ! 

The very first line " Welcome foolish mortals " made me just giggle . 

You begin the film with a married couple with 2 kids ( pretty standard Disney stuff ) , and the dad is too busy at work ( again , par for the course , but we have been doing this since at least " Mary Poppins , " you know ? ) . 

So with one phone call , the family is drawn into " the house . " 

That the dad is Eddie Murphy to me isn't that special a thing . 

I think Eddie Murphy is less funny than he used to be , but he is one of only a handful of comedic black movie stars today . 

You enter the house and see the cobwebs on the grandiose front entryhall . 

The monolithic ceilings , the candlelit hallways , the suits of armor , the gigantic fireplace ( might be known as gates of Hell , or it might not ) . 

The busts in the walls move and watch you , there are hidden stairways , and most and best of all , there are ghosts everywhere . 

There are good ones and bad ones , and all the family take off in different directions with the mom being the most sought after by the house's owner . 

I'm not going to give away the plot . 

Suffice it to say there is a trip to the cemetery with ghouls worse than in the new " Pirates of the Carribean " movie . 

But they don't last long . 

And , of course , the boy learns to be a man in the process . 

The lady's head in the crystal ball is there , and she's even green . 

There's a barber shop quartet of busts , and even the hearse fits in there somehow . 

The ending is where the bad guys get their due , and it is , after all , a Disney comedy . 

This movie is not too scary for the youngest of children , but the plot might confuse kids under 8 or 9 . PG is a good rating for a few mild oaths . 

Generally , if everyone would keep in mind that Disney makes things for children ( and there are always new ones coming along ! ! ! ) , they would know that this is just a wonderful experience , compared to THE CAT IN THE HAT which is obscene from what I've heard and read . 

See this movie ; take anyone . 

It kept my attention , and I am very Disney-fied . 

It lasts 110 minutes , and they are fabulous times . 

Well acted , well conceived , and great effects . 

A great Disney romp ! 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals no details about the movie''s plot . 

As the parent of a 5 year old who had just returned from a one week vacation at Walt Disney World , the inescapable fact was that we WERE going to see this movie (unless it was X-rated due to full-frontal nudity , etc. ) whether we adults liked it or not . 

After reading some of the critics reviews on the web , I had resigned myself that this would be an evening of altruistic self-sacrifice for the benefit of my child . 

Boy , was I wrong . 

The atmosphere of the movie was very similar to the Haunted Mansion ride at W.D.W. , yet the sets were even more elaborate . 

The casting was more than adequate . 

Eddie Murphy has found a new niche in the role of the well-intentioned , somewhat misguided father , similar to that he portrayed in Daddy Day Care . 

The rest of the cast was credible , with the most noteworthy performance from Terence Stamp as the creepy butler . 

Despite rumors to the contrary , there actually was a decent plot . 

The special effects were flawless and sometimes subtle . 

This is not the usual in-your-face CGI tour-de-force Hollywood product . 

It was a little scarier than I expected , but it was not too scary for my 5 year old . 

There was some mild swearing , but nothing that a kid doesn't hear on T.V. these days . 

Our whole family enjoyed it , and we all want to see it again . 

I think that many of the unfavorable reviews this movie has received have come from those who have had inappropriate expectations and have prejudged the type of movie they expect it to be . 

This movie is not a comedy just because it has Eddie Murphy in it , and it is not a horror movie just because of the subject matter . 

One could say that it suffers from typecasting . 

I personally don't want to take my five year old to a "real " Eddie Murphy comedy or a "real " horror movie . 

If you are looking for what passes today for "wholesome family entertainment" , a movie that will entertain your youngster without teaching him a new vocabulary , as well as not boring you to tears , then this is the movie for you . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

I've got to admit that the first time I saw the trailer for Calendar Girls I wasn't exactly charged with anticipation . 

The trailer did manage to make the film look fun , but the concept strongly reminded me of The Full Monty , which is a film I personally found a little overrated . 

If I wanted to add further concerns I could tell you about how I decided to search Epinions for some reviews on the film , and my search revealed nothing but a small selection of more , adult titles . 

Nevertheless I recognized that not only did the trailer look fun , but I had been pleasantly surprised by another British comedy that didn't appeal to me , Bend It Like Beckham . 

With those thoughts running through my mind I decided to throw caution to the wind and go down to the local cinema to see Calendar Girls . 

I'm glad I went to see it now , because the film has remained just that . 

Fun ! 

It tells the story of 2 friends named Chris and Annie who are members of their local Womens Institute , but when Annie's husband comes down with Leukemia their lives are shattered . 

Before he died he wrote a poem about his flowers , and mentioned how flowers are like Women , they get more beautiful with age ( note-this does not necessarily reflect my own opinion ) . 

After he's died the 2 of them decide to try and raise some money for a comfortable sofa in the hospital waiting room so that other grieving families can at least have a little comfort . 

However since the women's Institute never makes money off their sales Chris decides to try a different approach , and gets a few of the other members to join her in making a nude calendar . 

That's nude , not naked , because they think that as long as they keep themselves covered behind fruit and things then it will be OK . 

Needless to say the Calendar is more than a local success , and by the time Hollywood beckons they have enough money to buy a settee and still donate 99 % of their earnings to cancer research . 

Yet was the cost worth it ? 

As with most comedy's of this type the main reason is succeeds is it's absolutely charming cast . 

The 2 main characters alone are played by award winning actresses , Chris by Helen Mirran ( The Madness Of King George ) and Annie by Julie Walters ( Educating Rita ) and both give wonderful performances . 

Mirran absolutely nails the role of the fun loving Chris who has to remain down to earth for the sake of her companions . 

Walters gives a touching performance as the grieving widow determined to do anything to make money for others in her situation , but together their partnership becomes even more than the sum of it's parts . 

They display an amazing amount of chemistry and play off of each other's style just enough to keep the characters believable . 

They're supported well by an absolutely stellar cast though . 

The cast features such names as Penelope Wilton ( Carrington ) Celia Emrie ( Bridgette Jones Diary ) and Ciaran Hinds ( Tomb Raider 2 ) among others . 

Yet most memorable of the entire cast is One Foot In The Grave's , Annette Crosbie , who plays Miss September , Jerssie . 

I remember seeing her and just expecting her to be playing an uptight , prim and proper lady . 

Especially when she came out talking with one of the most believable posh English accents yet filmed . 

However this confusion was the cause of some of the films bigger laughs as she was one of the more supportive characters . 

Crosbie and the other actresses didn't have to rely on just themselves though because they had the support of some good writers . 

The film featured quite a few genuine laugh out loud moments , such as the scene where Chris's son and his friend walk in whilst she's demonstrating the modeling . 

That and other jokes had the audience literally roaring with laughter . 

Yet what I liked best about the writing was not the jokes themselves , but with the way the material was handled . 

It's based on a true story , but that hasn't prevented historical inaccuracies in the past , and whilst I don't really know anything about what really happened , I do know that the film is more than just another feel good comedy . 

It actually gets the whole central story of making the calendar out of the way surprisingly early , but then goes on to examine the effects that modeling nude had on their lives . 

Chris's teenage son feels so humiliated by the calendar that he turns to , what he believes are drugs ; and another of the women arrives home to find her husband leaving her for another woman . 

Then as calendar really finds success they find themselves being exploited by people who have come to expect nudity from them . 

Throughout the film the material was sensitively and honestly handled in this same manner . 

Before I finish I will give mention to the films nudity . 

It's never strong or prolonged but there are a few moments of nudity in the film that will likely earn the same sort of childish comments as Cathy Bates infamous scene in About Schmidt . 

I'll try to avoid those sort of comments here , but needless to say there will likely be some going in who wont be expecting any real nudity . 

For example I went in knowing the concept and was hoping that the nudity would remain what you see in the photo's , but in between the shoots there is some brief nudity , and the shoots themselves get a little close to the bar of a 12 rated movie . 

However you feel about nudity in films , it's unlikely that many people will actually want to see this so I posted this little warning here . 

If you don't think you'll mind some mild nudity involving older ladies though , then Calendar Girls is a fun , well acted and at times emotional movie that's worth seeing . 

Calendar Girls is rated 12A , for mild nudity and some bad language 

The Haunted Mansion was a fun Disney movie . 

Because Disney produced this film , you would nt expect the film to be scary , but to the contrary , my wife screamed several times and grabbed my arm for protection . 

I was on my honeymoon in Lake Tahoe when I went to see this movie . 

My new wife thought it would be fun to see so I agreed to see it with her . 

I was thinking that it would be lame as I thought Eddie Murphy did a bad job on Dr. Doolittle . 

I was shocked to find that the movie , Haunted Mansion , was actually acted out and directed very well . 

The scary scenes mostly were a little scary and the funny scenes were funny enough to be laughed at . 

I cant remember any part of the movie where I wanted to look down at my watch and see how much longer we had before we could leaveand Im a stubborn goat . 

The film would be wonderful for children of any age as long as children under 8 had an adult close by for those scary moments . 

There are very many wonderful treats film-wise ( effects and sounds ) . 

I am one who analyzes films enough to predict the next action taken , but this film gave a few surprises ( I will be creating films as a computer animator , thus I analyze ) . 

I found it interesting that the story was told well and it corresponded enough with the ride to have a familiar tone , but had enough originality that I did not feel as though I was on the ride I have ridden hundreds of times before ( being a former mouse employee ) . 

The beginning of the story took a while to run and made me a little anxious to get on with the rest of the film so I could see how the movie would relate to the ride . 

I would suggest this movie as a date movie or a friends or family  gathering movieand a fun one to watch in a theater setting . 

As for home viewing , I would suggest it if you have a good bass backing . 

Wonderful job , Disney 

Not since Dan Akroyd donned his own thread bare red and white outfit , in the movie Trading Places , has the world seen such a sad and pathetic Santa Claus as the one played by Billy Bob Thornton in the newly released motion picture Bad Santa . 

Kris Kringle will never be looked at in the same way again for anyone that sees this hilarious uptake on the bearded man from the North . 

Willie T. Stokes ( Thornton ) as Santa Claus is like having Mr. T play Peter Pan . 

It just does nt sound right . 

Thats what makes Bad Santa such a hilariously funny movie and one that I think fans around the world are going to love , possibly over and over . 

Remember the loveable Edmund Gwenn in the classic Christmas movie , Miracle on 34th Street ? 

You remember him for all the right reasons . 

He was caring , honest , and enthusiastic about being Santa . 

Youre going to walk out of Bad Santa remembering Thornton for all of the wrong reasons . 

He cusses , smokes , drinks . 

And that s all before breakfast . 

Manhola Dargis of the Los Angeles times says of Thorntons character ; A man whose talent for expletives would give . 

Dr Dre pause . " 

Tony Cox , who is probably best known for his work as the limo driver in Jim Carreys Me , Myself , and Irene movie , plays Marcus , Willies assistant . 

For such a little guy he has a big job trying to keep Willie in line just long enough to finish another job and another Christmas season . 

This is nt an easy task considering Willies tendencies but one that Marcus must do . 

The beautiful , sexy , and talented Lauren Graham , last seen with Keanu Reeves in Sweet November , plays Sue , a smoking hot bartender with a thing for Santa . 

Graham brings a wonderful glow to the screen in her scenes with Thornton . 

Her beautiful smile is breathtaking and could melt ice off the Rocky Mountains . 

Bernie Mac plays Gin , a chain smoking , orange eating mall security man that finds out more than he should about Willie and Marcus and gets more than he bargained for . 

His scene with Tony where they try to get a drunken Willie out of the mall is so funny I had tears in my eyes . 

Newcomer Brett Kelly plays the kid , Thurman Merman . 

Snot nosed , overweight , and generally messed up in the head , Kellys scenes with Thornton bring out the humanity in a man that otherwise has none . 

The late comedian John Ritter has a small part in this movie as the mall manager that finds out he may have hired the wrong type of person to be their store Santa after finding Bad Santa banging a heavy set woman in the dressing room of the Three Times a Lady  department . 

This movie , even with Thorntons disturbing language and attitude , was possibly one of the funniest that I have seen lately . 

Willies way with the women , his alcoholism , his smoking , all of these things made me want to love the character , to love the movie . 

This movie is nt for little kids . 

The language alone would make a Hip Hop crowd blush . 

But for adults , this movie could be one of the best of the holiday season . 

I have nt seen Elf  yet but I seriously cannot imagine it being as funny for adults as Bad Santa . 

Leave the kids at home and enjoy Bad Santa as soon as you can . 

As a matter of record let me just say that if you are trying to quit smoking you probably dont want to see this movie . 

I think I got lung cancer ( I know this is no laughing matter ) just watching this movie . 

And if you are a recovering alcoholic you might want to sit this one out as well . 

I am willing to bet that Stolichnaya Vodka was either paid or paid to have their product so visible in this movie . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

I first saw a preview for Bad Santa about four weeks ago . 

I hadn't laughed that hard or that consistently at just a preview in a very very long time . 

That being said , I was nervous about this flick because there are oh so many times where the preview shows you the only good and or funny parts . 

For those who had the same fear as I did , you may have no fear . 

Bad Santa is the most deliciously gut-busting adults only comedy since 1999's South Park : Bigger , Longer and Uncut . 

Directed by Terry Zwigoff ( Ghost World ) , and produced by the Coen brothers ( Fargo , The Big Lebowski ) , Bad Santa stars Billy Bob Thornton as Willie T Soke , a plus-size bottom sex craved depressed alcoholic who cracks safes . 

His partner in crime is Marcus ( Tony Cox , Me , Myself and Irene ) . 

As a team , they set up shop in a different city each Christmas , Thornton as the department store Santa , Cox as one of his elves . 

On Christmas Eve , they rob the department store blind , usually to the tune of six figures in cash and untold value in merchandise . 

The set up this year is Phoenix , Arizona . 

They get a job at a mall , replacing a 5 years running Santa thanks to the penny pinching attitude of the mall/store ( it's unclear which one he really is ) manager , played by the late John Ritter in one of his final film roles . 

Within five minutes of having the job , however , Willie is already being looked at suspiciously by the manager , thanks to his constant swearing and his general drunk look . 

The manager then goes to the mall security guard , Gin ( Bernie Mac ) , who is on a power trip that just won't end . 

But the mall/department store part of the story is just the beginning . 

Within a day or two of beginning their jobs , an out of touch , overweight slob of a kid who is stuck with an awful name , Thurman Merman ( Brett Kelly ) , visits Santa at the mall and quickly becomes enamored of Thornton , despite his surly and un-Santa like behavior . 

" The Kid " ( as Thornton refers to him throughout the movie ) follows Thornton to a bar . 

It's in this bar where Thornton meets Sue ( Lauren Graham ) , a girl with a big time Santa fetish . 

When Thornton realizes the kid has followed him , he takes him back home , where Thurman lives with his whacked out grandmother ( his parents are away for reasons that are revealed through the course of the film ) , played by Cloris Leachman . 

Over the course of the movie , Marcus does his best to keep Willie out of trouble . 

It isn't easy , given Willie's penchant for having sex in the plus size fitting rooms , showing up late and or drunk to work , and becoming slower and slower on the safecracking year after year . 

Willie , meanwhile , becomes a sort of father figure to Thurman , despite the fact that he sees nothing but a loser in the kid . 

He questions why he doesn't stand up to the skate punks who pick on him , and tries his best to teach him to fight . 

One might think that with this set up , a warm , happy ending is in the cards . 

Think again . 

What makes Bad Santa such a good movie , and not just a funny one ( an apt description for say , Mallrats , which is far from good , but damned funny ) , is that it holds no expectations for itself . 

It crashes down on the holiday season the way that the previously mentioned South Park film crashed down on musicals . 

The Kid does bring out a bit of humanity or soul or whatever in Thornton's character , but because Thornton's' Santa' is so black in spirit , any redemption or humanity is short lived . 

The one drawback to the film is in some of its pacing and editing . 

The scenes between Ritter and Mac in particular feel like they weren't even shot at the same time with them in the same room . 

Completely vulgar and politically incorrect ( a few choice losers are protesting because it's put out by a Disney subsidiary , I say to all of you : GET A LIFE) , Bad Santa is most certainly NOT for the kiddies ( as if the previews didn't already make THAT expressly clear ) . 

So if you and the wife/husband want a night out alone with a film that will make you laugh harder than any other film this year , get a babysitter and go see Bad Santa . 

Besides the kids , you may want to leave your pretensions at the house as well . 

Bad Santa has officially topped Pirates of the Caribbean and Bruce Almighty as my favorite film of the year . 

I give it 4.5 stars and a hearty HO HO HO recommendation . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

If the title of this review offends you , stop reading right now . 

Terry Zwigoff's " Bad Santa " is not for you . 

But if you have a soft spot in your funny bone for the darker aspects of human nature , if the caustic comedy of directors like Danny DeVito and the Woody Allen of " Deconstructing Harry " causes you to break out in uncontrollable guffaws , if you're as fed up as Charlie Brown with the commercialization of Christmas cheer and would like to see this cynical marketing of a simple holiday blown a wet , beery razzberry , then read on , boys and girls , because " Bad Santa " is the film you've been waiting for your whole life . 

Many critics praise an actor's bravery when they take on a role like that of Cuba Gooding's mentally challenged football booster in the recent syrup production machine " Radio" . 

But a character like that is calculated to warm hearts and win Oscars ; the risk factor is minimal unless you overplay and come off as a caricature . 

You want a risk ? 

How about trying out a role like " Bad Santa "'s Willie T. Soke ? 

Played by Billy Bob Thornton ( in a role originally intended for Bill Murray ) , Willie is a boozy , foul-mouthed , degenerate nihilist with a soul as black as coal ( which is more of a Christmas gift than he ever got from his abusive monster of a dad ) who uses the Santa cover to case department stores which he then robs on Christmas Eve with his partner Marcus ( Tony Cox ) , a little person who plays Santa's elf . 

All the while , Willie abuses the kids who come to see him , uses more four-letter words than the entire population of South Park , steals cars , carries on an affair with a waitress ( Lauren Graham ) with a fetish for Santa hats , nails overweight women in the big and tall dressing stalls , and drowns the fire of his self-hatred with enough booze to swamp the Titanic ( he rides up the escalator to " Santa's Village " lying on his face , a broken bottle clutched in his jolly old fist ) . 

At one point , he wets his Santa pants right in front of the children , and this is actually one of his more forgivable offenses because he's so drunk he doesn't even realize what he's done . 

All the while , Willie spews invective at anyone who gets within his field of vision , cursing Christmas and family and the whole shebang . 

Playing a character like this is a REAL risk . 

If you play it badly , it's just an embarrassment . 

If you play it well , some people will not be able to separate the actor from the character and excoriate the performer as a monster just for doing his job to the best of his ability . 

It is to the endless credit of Thornton , an actor who has made a career out of socially maladjusted misfits ( " Sling Blade" , " A Simple Plan " ) , that he seems to have taken to this role without a moment's thought about what a monster like Willie could do to his public image . 

He growls the character's endless obscenities with a phlegm-throated relish , throws himself into twisted misbehavior with heedless abandon ...and what's most amazing of all , somehow manages , against all our better instincts , to move us with this portrayal of a hateful man by never letting us forget that he hates himself most of all . 

" I am not Santa Claus" , he tells a little boy . 

" If anything , I'm living proof that there isn't any Santa Claus . " 

Willie is a man who has lost his capacity to believe in anything , most of all himself , and the wasted excess that is his life is no Dionysian revel , but rather the extended suicide of a man who feels that he has more than earned all his self-inflicted suffering ( at one point , feeling that even he is being too easy on himself , Willie tries to take himself out with carbon monoxide in a garage ...all while wearing the Santa suit , of course ) . 

This is a character which , if handled incorrectly , could have ruined Thornton's career . 

Lucky for him , and for us , that the actor sees the humanity in Willie and lays it bare , along with the baser indignities man is capable of inflicting upon himself and the world . 

This is a monumental comic performance , funny as hell and lived in down to the gin-soaked bones by a great actor , and the Oscar nominees are incomplete if they do not include him ( which I have every reason to suspect they will not , as Gooding's Rain Man of the gridiron is much more the type of up-with-people role the Oscars tend to reward ) . 

For all its dark R-rated excesses , " Bad Santa " is ultimately , like many of the greatest Christmas movies , a story of redemption . 

Willie , in Phoenix with Marcus for their annual Christmas scam ( they've been pulling their Santa heist for years , living high off the proceeds , but always financially dry as a bone come Thanksgiving ) , finds that the job will not come as easy as it has to him in the past . 

Their department store's sharp-tongued detective ( Bernie Mac ) and jittery manager ( John Ritter in his final film role ) are keeping a close eye on this suspiciously woozy Saint Nick . 

His shakes are getting so bad he can barely crack a safe anymore . 

What's more , he has somehow , against all odds , made a friend . 

His name is Thurman Merman ( Brett Kelly ) , and he's a sad , overweight eight-year-old boy who latches on to Willie and won't let go . 

At first , Willie takes advantage of the situation , moving into Thurman's house , which the boy shares only with a deeply out-of-it grandmother ( Cloris Leachman ) ; his father is in prison for insider trading , his mother "is in heaven with God and the baby Jesus ...and the talking walnut " . 

But soon , Willie starts to realize that this sad sack of a kid , with his snot-crusted upper lip and Cupid-curls hair , who gets beaten up on a daily basis by skateboard punks and who exalts over an almost-all-C's report card , needs almost as much help as Willie himself . 

And Thurman , to his credit , does not believe that this bleary-eyed human trash heap is really Santa Claus . 

He just desperately needs to believe in something , or else one day he just might find himself in a Santa suit , throwing up in an alley , just like his new best friend . 

Thankfully , " Bad Santa " manages to tell this Yuletide story of a monster's salvation without resorting to the " Will Ferrell learns the true meaning of Christmas " cliches that have sent many a holiday audience into sugar shock over the years . 

Director Zwigoff's past films , including the remarkable documentary " Crumb " and the dark but surprisingly sweet " Ghost World " , have evinced a soft spot for the disenfranchised and misunderstood souls of the world , and the miracle of those films is that he allows us to see and embrace the humanity of these creatures without soft-pedaling the weirdness and nihilism that has made them outsiders to begin with . 

Thurman's plight does make a dent in Willie's stone heart , but a dent is all it is ; for all we know , he'll go right on boozing and cussing and banging fat chicks till his liver gives out and they carry him out in a pine box . 

Kelly , likewise , is not your typical cookie-cutter cute movie kid . 

Take " The Cat in the Hat "'s Spencer Breslin , add about seventy-five pounds , yellow-crusted underwear , ill-fitting shorts , and an intensely eyes-locked-on-you manner that is as creepy as it is amusing , and you can understand why this kid gets pounded on every day . 

But when Willie is dumbstruck by Thurman's simple sweet Christmas gift of a wooden pickle , when Thurman announces that Santa hasn't brought him a Christmas present for the last two years "because I know I'm just a dips--t loser " ...you can't help but root for these guys . 

Maybe not to become president , but at least for Thurman to get the pink stuffed elephant he so dearly wants for Christmas . 

At least for Willie to find a reason to rise from the booze-and-puke puddle that is his life and see another dawn . 

That Zwigoff manages to move us with these characters , all the while causing us to laugh in disbelief at the extremity of Willie's awfulness and the film's lack of faith in the standard Hollywood-Christmas quick fix , is a great testament to both the director's delicate touch and to the skilled work of writers John Requa and Glenn Ficarra , who also scripted the darker-and-funnier-than-expected " Cats and Dogs " ( the script went through several uncredited rewrites , including one by executive producers Joel and Ethan Coen and one by Zwigoff himself ) . 

Still , regardless of how unexpectedly touching the film may be , " Bad Santa " is still the blackest comedy in many a moon . 

I am personally tired of Hollywood pictures billing themselves at "outrageous" , when really all that means is that they include a few gross jokes about bodily fluids ending up in somebody's Sprite . 

" Bad Santa " is the first comedy I've seen in a long time that is outrageous in the literal sense of the term ; several critics have already excoriated it as mean-spirited beyond redemption , and a possibly-apocryphal internet news item had Walt Disney CEO Michael Eisner ( Disney owns Miramax subsidiary Dimension , which released this film ) denouncing the picture as an insult to the memory of the company's founder . 

And the film is guilty of everything it's been accused of . 

It's foul-mouthed , it's sex-and-booze-drenched , it literally pees on the good feelings many of us have for the holiday season , it scores laughs off of midgets and elderly shut-ins and fat kids and drunks . 

But you know what ? 

It gets those laughs . 

The audience I saw the film with laughed throughout the film , at several points so loudly that I missed lines of dialogue completely . 

Of course , there were people that got up and walked out , including the middle-aged couple sitting next to me . 

And to them I say , hey , different strokes . 

If you want a nicer Christmas movie , " Elf " is still playing across the hall . 

" Bad Santa " is a refreshing antidote to all those other holiday movies that wrap the season in prepackaged , mass-marketed " cheer " . 

It's a brazen , daring , no-holds-barred comic assault on many of the values that we hold most dear , from the sanctity of family to the importance of good personal hygiene . 

And , amazingly enough , it still manages to carry a potent message about how no person is beyond salvation if he can find it within his pickled , diabolical soul to commit one act that is for the good of the world and others . 

" Bad Santa " reminds us of a message that is always useful to hear : no one , even the most loathsome of us all , is completely without value . 

It's the same message as " It's a Wonderful Life" , albeit delivered with a lot more f-words and flying liquor bottles . 

And I suspect , among a small core of twisted , clever misfits , " Bad Santa " will join that Jimmy Stewart chestnut as a perennial holiday favorite . 

Best enjoyed , of course , with eggnog . 

HEAVILY fortified . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot . 

So relieved Bad Santa had a happy compromising ending . 

What with the main character , Willie Stokes ( Billy Bob Thornton ) being a cussing , boozing , womanizing , thieving , insulting Santa it would be a let down if it did nt have a happy ending . 

Picture a man who was abused as a child growing up to be a fake Santa in order to rob the department store safe and expensive clothing , which is fenced . 

Then taking off for Florida for a few months until the winter holiday restarts . 

Thats Willie and his elf partner in crime , Marcus ( Tony Cox ) , a 3 foot Black dwarf . 

Marcus tries to keep Willie in line just long enough to pull off the big score . 

After that hes done with Willie and does nt want to see him again until the next Holiday season when they start up posing as Santa and his elf . 

Willie is the worst Santa . 

He insults the kids (  Whadya want  Okay , get outta here  ) and arrives at work drunk . 

When they venture to Arizona with their act , Store Manager John Ritter thinks hes got a salary break : two for one . 

He soon becomes suspicious of the two when he catches Willie using foul language in front of the kids and fornicating with a female clerk . 

The store detective ( Bernie Mac ) is consulted , and starts to investigate their past . 

When he figures out what theyre doing  robbing the store  he wants a cut of the loot . 

Thankfully , there is a charming kid , Thuman Merman ( portly cherubic Brett Kelly ) who believes in Willie and adopts him as a surrogate dad . 

( I wont reveal where the real dad is ) No matter how awfully Willie talks to the kid , he so desperately wants a male figure he accepts Willie for what he is . 

Theres an attractive barmaid ( Lauren Graham ) who has a fetish for Santas and has fun as Willies sex mate . 

If these characters werent so unbelievably funny they would be implausible . 

Everything that s politically incorrect ( alcohol binging , swearing , loud-mouth insults ) is there . 

Leave your purity and religiosity at home . 

Billy Bob Thornton is such a versatile actor . 

He played character-driven supporting roles and now hes lead in a black comedy . 

With a scruffy unshaven beard and a slouching body , his makes Willie memorable although unfavorably . 

He and Tony Cox demonstrate perfect comic timing as crime buddies . 

Brett Kelly plays the kid with such sympathy and earnestness you want to throw him a teddy bear for comfort . 

You will laugh when you dont want to laugh and feel embarrassed for doing so . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals everything about the movie's plot . 

If you use "bad " to mean "good" , then Bad Santa is very bad , indeed . 

Billy Bob Thorton plays Willy Stokes , a drunkard/safecracker , who with the help of his dwarf-friend Marcus ( Tony Cox ) robs shopping malls after posing as Santa during the holiday season . 

On this particular go , the pair winds up in Arizona , an inspired choice since the Southern California thing has been done to death . 

John Ritter plays a department store manager , who in an attempt to cut-costs , fires the store's regular Santa and hires the cheaper Billy-bob . 

Then , the fun begins ... 

Billy-bob is so unredeemable and disgusting that you can't help , but laugh when brat after brat climbs aboard his tipsy lap and lists their demands . 

Billy-Bob whines and scowls his way through each day , and store manager , John Ritter , and partner in crime , Tony Cox become more and more agitated by Billy Bob's behavior . 

Meanwhile , Billy-bob has met Sue ( Lauren Graham ) , who has a thing for being naughty , and a chubby snot-nosed loser played perfectly by Brett Kelly . 

( Brett's performance is perfect ; he at once is repulsive and yet , somehow sympathetic . ) 

The movie , however , begins to take a dark turn with about thirty minutes left . 

The mall's security officer finds out about the previous mall robberies by Marcus and Willy , and blackmails the pair . 

That in itself wouldn't be so bad , but eventually Marcus and his horrible girlfriend kill the security guard and during their annual robbery , double-cross Billy-bob . 

By this point , Billy-bob has not exactly reformed his ways , but now , at least cares enough about the fat loser kid to want to get him a gift ( a pink elephant ) . 

He's chased to the kids house where he's shot eight times while trying to deliver the stuffed elephant . 

I guess to the tune of a Christmas miracle , he survives . 

The film manages to revive itself a little with a letter that Billy-Bob sends the fat kid from prison and the movie ends , happily . 

I really enjoyed most of this film . 

The focus group ending bothered me ; it felt a little bit like the writer didn't know how to end it . 

I wasn't a huge fan of the dark turn it took , but I didn't think it hurt the film as much as the happy ending . 

The performances were all really fantastic ( all the supporting cast did wonderful jobs ) . 

The script could have used some tightening near the end , but as I said , the "letter " made up for it a bit . 

I would highly recommend this to anyone who thinks what the malls have done to Christmas is a crime . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

Calendar Girls , which has already seen a release in Britain , will be making its way over the Atlantic in time for the holiday season . 

Luckily , I get these nice invitations from the Philadelphia Film Society to attend sneak previews and premieres , so my wife and I found ourselves treated to a free screening of this film a good month before it hits theaters . 

This is not the type of film I normally enjoy seeing in the theater , by the way . 

For me , the big-screen experience is all about stunning visuals , thundering sounds , and jaw-dropping special effects . 

That said , I completely enjoyed Calendar Girls as a happy , spirited , light-hearted , peculiarly English comedy . 

Characters and Plot 

The Knapely chapter of the Women's Institute ( W.I. ) isn't very interesting . 

In fact , it's downright boring . 

Topics like the history of broccoli and carpets tend to predominate the presentations , and right from the beginning , we find ourselves laughing along with our two main protagonists , Annie ( Julie Walters ) and Chris ( Helen Mirren ) , as they suffer through the deadly dull pontifications that make up the WI meetings . 

Early in the film , however , tragedy sets in as Annie's husband begins an unsuccessful battle with leukemia . 

Fairly soon after his death , the Knapely W.I. finds itself once again in the position of having to publish its annual calendar for charity . 

Instead of the usual church buildings or pictures of Yorkshire , however , Chris decides that something different is needed . 

After receiving some inspiration from one of her son's "adult " magazines and a gas-station biker-chick calendar , she conceives the idea of a calendar picturing various members of the W.I. in the nude . 

Of course , they would be doing very W.I.-appropriate activities while in their birthday suits , so it would be more classy than crass . 

The money raised would go to the local hospital's leukemia ward . 

Soon , despite opposition from the local chapter president , and some last-minute pleas to the general W.I. convention , the calendar goes to press . 

What follows is a media frenzy that was entirely unexpected , leading to BBC spots , tabloid reporters , Late Night appearances , sleazy Hollywood directors , and lots and lots of money raised for the local hospital . 

What Did I Think ? 

I really liked Calendar Girls . 

Part of its charm as a film is its very charming cast of characters , especially the female leads . 

Helen Mirren sparkles as Chris , portraying a small-town woman with an abundance of energy , enthusiasm , and grit . 

Julie Walters brings a quiet poignancy to Annie , with an undercurrent of humor and grace . 

Almost all of the other W.I. women are very believable in their characters , with a whole range of body types and personalities to round out the calendar ( and film ) . 

One of the wonderful elements of this picture is its celebration of beauty outside of Hollywood and magazine pages . 

Helen Mirren , undeniably a very attractive older woman , brings a spark of glamour to the story , but the very ordinariness of many of the other women , and the art with which they are presented in the calendar is a refreshing reminder that beauty can be more than we see in Cosmopolitan and Access Hollywood . 

Despite all the high-sounding declarations above about beauty and truth , the simple fact is that this is a fun movie . 

The subject matter lends itself to all sorts of hilarity . 

From the reactions of the models' husbands and families , to the media blitz , there are many moments of outright laughter throughout the film . 

Anything Wrong With It ? 

There were a few flaws I found in Calendar Girls . 

A few conflicts were developed that never found any resolution in the film . 

Of course , there is no absolute necessity to wrap everything up neatly by the end of an hour and a half , but it is nice to see at least the beginnings of a resolution on most of the issues . 

One particular storyline involving Chris's son does provide a few comedy and a few drama moments , but peters out , or is lost in the wash of the story's climax . 

The other small complaint I could express regards the Hollywood furor that develops around the Knapely women . 

This segment of the film , while funny at times , devolves into a not-too-subtle critique of Hollywood and the television industry . 

I'm all for critiquing the establishment , by the way , but to my mind , transferring the movie's action to L.A. stripped away some of the English charm that had attended it to that point . 

That said , it doesn't by any means ruin the film . 

I just found that portion to be a bit more forced than the rest . 

Final Thoughts 

Calendar Girls is quite simply an all-around enjoyable film . 

The acting is solid , the premise is believable ( good thing , as it's based on a true story ) , and the whole experience is rife with humor . 

The few flaws hardly detract from the general sense of enjoyment engendered by the movie . 

Even if this kind of film isn't your cup of tea , think about renting it when it hits your local video store . 

It's definitely worth seeing if you're home for a quiet evening . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot . 

The juxtaposition of the words British and comedy  is enough to strike fear into the hearts of even the hardiest cinema-goer . 

However , Calendar Girls  proves to be a rather impressive exception to the norm . 

The film is based on the real-life events from a Yorkshire village a few years ago , although the Director was keen on maintaining that the individual characters in the film are not themselves based on the real-life women . 

Calendar Girls  centres on the Knapeley Womens Institute , a clan of Yorkshire women who meet every week to sing and receive talks on thrilling matters such as carpets and broccoli . 

Annie ( Julie Walters ) and Chris ( Helen Mirren ) are long-standing friends who faithfully turn-up , despite the soporific subject matter . 

When Annies husband dies from leukaemia , the effervescent Chris comes up with the idea of the WI raising money for a new sofa in the hospital in Johns memory . 

Thanks to some creative inspiration from her sons soft-porn magazine and big-breasted dolly-bird on the wall of the local bicycle repair shop , she comes up with the idea of a nude calendar . 

Whilst most of the group are initially reluctant , the fifty-something middle-class folk are gradually talked round into stripping off ( nude , not naked , Annie is keen to point out ) , with their biblical parts ( or front bottoms  if you like ) carefully concealed behind implements traditionally associated with the WI. 

However , none of them could imagine the impact that the calendar would have over the coming weeks , as it transcends them to superstar status way beyond their village . 

However , as Hollywood beckons , relationships begin to suffer  

Many films based on fact have a tendency to be over-the-top and skew stories so that they are barely recognisable . 

However , it s the films ability to maintain the earthy northern wit and its subtle comedy which really makes it into a winner . 

The northerness and nudity inevitably leads it to be compared to The Full Monty , but its quirks differentiate it from its predecessor and there does not appear to be an intention to mimic . 

Mirren and Walters , surely two of the most talented British actresses of their generation , give great performances and bounce off each other beautifully , easily switching from comedy to drama when required without being hammy and trying too hard . 

It is particularly interesting that Mirren , best known for her ice-maiden Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect is the bubblier , more outgoing of the pair whilst Walters , Mrs Overall in Acorn Antiques  is more reserved . 

John ( played perfectly by Alderton ) is always optimistic and upbeat during his illness , and the scenes with Anne are warm and touching rather than melancholy and melodramatic . 

This is a refreshing change from the usual screen morbid portrayals of terminal illness on the big screen . 

The rest of the WI is also fabulously portrayed thanks to some great performances from the cast . 

Annette Crosbie , Celia Imrie and Penelope Wilton all add a nice depth to their characters with some subtle touches . 

Complementing each other rather than any one person trying to dominate the screen , the marvellous cast match the playful script . 

Chriss sons adolescent awkwardness at her perceived embarrassing behaviour is also quite comedic . 

One possible criticism would be that the arguments between Anne and Chris in the later stages of the film perhaps seem a little tacked-on to try and create a mini-conflict . 

However , as youd imagine , it manages to resolve itself before too long and does nt detract from the overall feel-good factor . 

A good old-fashioned straightforward plot with the emphasis on script and characters rather than having a deep philosophical meaning , it is fantastically watchable and jam-packed with witty one-liners and should appeal to a wide ranging audience . 

I caught this movie on the comedy channel today , and want to find it on dvd now , for my collection . 

It's what I'd term the " stupid-funny " style , much like Mel Brooks would make . 

If you're one of those people that's easily offended by non "politically correct " movies , steer clear of this one . 

If you're capable of laughing at the world , and especially at yourself , watch this movie ! 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot . 

I just want to be upfront on the following . 

I still haven't forgiven Tom for what he did to Nicole . 

To dump your wife through a divorce petition is pretty sleazy . 

What's even sleazier is to abandon her while she's pregnant with your child and then try to say that the marriage was only enforce for 9 years 11 months so that you could skirt the 10 year California rule on split of assets . 

It's sleazy . 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way , let's talk about my strong like for Tom Cruise , the actor . 

I've always had a soft spot for the lovable creature that he is and by the time he made Top Gun , I was swearing my undying devotion to him . 

I don't think that he's a particularly gifted actor however , like Britney Spears , he is the consummate entertainer . 

I doubt that he'll ever win an Oscar for Best Actor . 

Why ? 

In the end , I think that his looks are what sabotage him . 

The best thing that could happen to him is an industrial accident . 

What does this have to do with The Last Samurai ? 

I'll get to that in a moment . 

Let's review the story , shall we ? 

It's 1876 . 

The movie opens up with Nathan Algren ( Tom Cruise ) sabotaging his own employment opportunities by funneling his anger and regret into a bottle of alcohol and an attitude of rebellion . 

What's he so upset about ? 

As a captain , he spent time fighting those savages and along the way , he massacred innocent women and children . 

That's enough to make any man with a conscious , drink . 

The Japanese government , recognizing his keen ability to get the job done , hires him to train their troops in the modern ways of war . 

Who is the enemy ? 

Their own people , specifically those who do not wish to see the modern ways take over their world . 

That effort is driven by the samurais and their honorable leader , Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe ) . 

Algren , for the right price , takes the job on . 

The Japanese peasants , who make up most of the emperor's army , are ill-prepared for any type of battle . 

Unfortunately , the government doesn't want to hear that and despite Algren's proof , they send a group in to hold the samurais back from disturbing a railroad . 

After the samurais kill most of the soldiers ( the others have ran ) , Algren is left to fight them off . 

Katsumoto , impressed and fascinated with the American , spares his life and takes him in as a prisoner . 

Algren is housed with the family of the samurai that he killed in battle . 

During the process , he detoxes , and learns to appreciate life for what it is . 

Did you think I just gave the entire movie away ? 

Well relax , I didn't . 

So back to this whole thing with Tom . 

What does his appearance have to do with The Last Samurai ? 

I felt like the entire time I was watching this movie , that Tom was miscast and had someone else been thrown into this role ( Edward Norton ? 

Hugh Jackman ? ) , 

I might have walked away liking it better . 

He was just too pretty for the role . 

Even the hap-hazard beard and scruff couldn't hide his pretty-boy face and that my friends , was distracting . 

In addition , I felt like his acting were pretty stiff . 

It's like he was aiming to be "technically " precise in everything that he did and that in turn seemed to stifle any of his emotional connections with other characters . 

The true gem of the film , acting wise , was Ken Watanbe . 

He had a screen presence that I haven't seen in a long time . 

His charisma ( magnetic , charming , forceful , and mysterious ) is what pushed me to recommend this movie and I really wish that the entire story would have focused around him and not Tom . 

In fact , you could have left Tom out of this and it would have been a better picture . 

But of course , Tom is the box office pull SO you gotta take the good with the bad . 

Now let's move on to two of my ( normally ) favorite producers/writers/directors in the world - Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz . 

I fell deeply in like with them when they were at the helm of Thirtysomething . 

I felt cheated that there was a lack of emotional bonding between the characters . 

I mean , there was some between Algren and Katsumoto ( but not nearly enough ) and virtually nothing but superficial ties with the rest of the characters . 

Although I'm thrilled that they didn't have Tom doin' everybody , I felt a little cheated about his interactions with the opposite sex . 

This movie was too long ( I had to pee ) and very predictable in parts ( I rolled my eyes ) . 

In addition , for a movie that didn't have enough emotional bonding , it relied a lot on melodrama to manipulate the audience . 

See important death scenes for more details . 

The editing together of the scenes was pretty good with the exception of the first 8-10 minutes . 

The scenes introducing Tom's character felt very disjointed . 

The technical aspects of the movie - from the cinematography to the battle scenes - were amazing . 

The fight/training scenes looked real and felt real . 

The choreography was over the top fantastic . 

I was duly impressed . 

The battle scenes seemed more like art than war - almost to the point of glamorization . 

Girls , if you strongly dislike blood and guts please know that while there is lots of blood shed , most of the scenes were not horribly gross . 

I only closed my eyes twice that I can remember . 

As far as the story goes , I can't vouch to any of the historical accuracies of it so if you are one of those sticklers for factual accounts , you might want to do your research before you go . 

I feel a little strange giving this movie such low marks considering that it had a some of the best technical stuff I've seen in a long time , a strong score , and Ken Watanabe however , if the studios want to pull in a wider audience than just battle buffs , they need to look beyond the technical perfections and evaluate the emotional aspects of the film . 

To recap : 

*/SYM Movie was TOO long . 

I had to pee but waited . 

*/SYM Tom is too pretty for this kind of role . 

*/SYM Ken Watanabe is a force to be reckoned with . 

*/SYM Boys will like this more than girls . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

The main problem with The Last Samurai is not that the plot is almost exactly the same as both Dances with Wolves  and Shogun , but that it assumes you ve seen both those movies , and cant seem to decide whether or not it thinks you want to see them again . 

If you ve seen both the full ten hours of Shogun , and the version where the mini-series is reduced to approximately the length of a feature film , you ve got some idea of whats going in The Last Samurai , and you know that somehow the whole point is lost in the trimming . 

You might similarly imagine the version of Dances with Wolves  that has an hour or so cut out of it . 

Now , if you have nt seen either of those films things get a little harder to explain . 

Imagine a book whose main purpose is to explore a culture ( to some degree or other ) by way of having an outsider suddenly thrust into it . 

Now imagine that instead of actually having a book like Shogun , with all its details about the culture relayed through the story and the character , you only have the Cliffs Notes of the book which just says , and he explores and comes to know the Japanese culture , and the ways , ideas , and ideals of the Samurai .  

Its left to you then to either be able to get something out of that line or not . 

Even all this does nt get you to the point that you can really connect with where The Last Samurai is going , because though Dances  and Shogun werent true stories , there was a decent truth  in them . 

They were fictional stories that attempted to take place in real times , and portray cultures ( to some extent ) as they really were . 

The Last Samurai is one step removed here , because it is nt a fictional story in that sense . 

The historically incorrect things Samurai does are enough to change the entire situation of Japan itself , and change the entire culture to a degree . 

Were not across the line into something like alternate-reality sci-fi , but were approaching it . 

The result is still a trip into the world of Samurai , but it s a trip that says , youve already seen Shogun , so we dont need to go into all that again , and were going down this other road anyway .  

All that said , there are only two things keeping this movie from being not only five stars , but also an instant classic ; it s ending ( and I mean the entire last thirty minutes ) , and its absolute lack of daring . 

Instead of daring , I might actually say its lack of honor ( to itself ) , but that is a jaunt toward irony I choose to avoid . 

You probably have a good guess at the story based on the comparisons Ive made , and you cant be far off . 

Captain Nathan Algren ( Tom Cruise ) , veteran of the Civil War , and many skirmishes with Indians , is hired to go to Japan and train an army . 

He learns that he is there to put down a certain Samurai , Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe ) , and his followers . 

Pressured to lead his new troops before theyre ready , he is captured by Katsumoto in the eventual miserable rout his army  suffers . 

He spends a long winter with Katsumoto and his family in a small village , because Katsumoto wants to know his enemy . 

Once we get beyond how Algren finds his way into the Samurai world , Shogun takes over , complete with a Japanese woman he can grow to love , and surprise night attack by Ninja . 

From here we mix equal parts Dances  and Shogun , choosing those elements that best serve the scenario weve created , and we have our plot . 

These three movies may have another connection , because if Kevin Costner , Richard Chamberlain , and Tom Cruise ever did anything right , it was their respective roles in these movies . 

Ive never been a Cruise fan , and even now he feels like an odd choice for the role to me , but he manages it far better than Id have predicted he could . 

Thats not to say hes perfect . 

Theres still quite a bit of the Hollywood star coming through in his performance , but hes not horrible , and certainly delivers something at least more watchable than his norm . 

Ken Watanabe , on the other hand , is wonderful . 

He delivers a quiet power , and undeniable presence that make you wish all the more that the film came through on its potential . 

There are a few brilliantly crafted scenes in which Katsumoto is in the background , off-center , and not exactly doing anything . 

He is still the absolute center of the scene , and your attention . 

Its hard to avoid the natural comparison to Shogun here , because though they are very different characters , Watanabe is basically playing Mifunes Shogun role . 

Thats the sort of situation where a comparison can spring to mind unbidden and wreak unfair havoc with your impression of an actors performance . 

Not so here . 

While Watanabe is nt quite going to stand up to a real comparison to Mifune , hes strong enough to at least make such a comparison a respectable question . 

Mentioning Costner , oddly enough , leads me to the cinematography by Oscar-winner John Toll . 

Thats because Samurai reminded me so much of James Muros first effort earlier this year , Open Range . 

From a cinematography stand-point , theyre practically the same movie . 

Theyre beautiful , but it s a very easy sort of beauty . 

Panoramic views of rolling plains and hills , sunrises with a hint of cloud cover , and sweeping shots of virgin forest , are not exactly on the cover of  Whats New and Exciting in Beautiful Pictures Monthly . 

Its gorgeous , sure , but it s not exactly doing anything . 

The difference is that when youre making a fairly simple cowboy film whose greatest asset is the fact that it does nt take itself too seriously , that s just the sort of thing that works . 

But , when youre making a semi-massive epic that puts itself out as having some definite goals , and definitely takes itself very seriously , well ... , then it s just a giant-name cinematographer cashing his check and going home early . 

All of this likely gives an impression which makes my rating confusing . 

I blame that on expectations , and perhaps a slightly unusual version of them . 

The mediocre hopes I had for this film built to high hopes as the movie actually progressed before my eyes . 

At about the halfway mark I was very hopeful indeed . 

I mentioned that there were two things keeping this from being a five-star movie , and this is where those come into play . 

It has no real daring to it , even though the first half will lead you to expect some . 

Once were a certain amount of the way in ( and even before that really , but you tend to overlook it in the earliest stages of a film ) we realize that everything is given to you in the simplest possible terms , with the least amount of effort , as easily  as can be managed . 

The other thing keeping the movie from being five-star status is its deplorable ending . 

An ending that is so typically Hollywood that it does its best to negate all that comes before it . 

Its stagy , and manages to avoid being described as formulaic only based on the uninteresting technicality that no ones used the formula before . 

Still , Im probably giving a very negative impression of everything to do with this movie that I give four stars ( out of five ) . 

I focus on the negatives , because far too many people are going to sing this movies praises far too much . 

It does nt really deserve many nominations , much less the wins it s somewhat likely to receive . 

Nevertheless , it s still above-average in my opinion , and though it has a lot going against it , it has a lot going for it as well . 

Cruise is nt great , but I have to admit that he is nt bad , and Watanabe alone made it worth it to me . 

Its certainly entertaining , and has some decent action moments that are actually relevantly connected to the plot . 

I may have said that it s an easy  sort of beautiful , but that does nt negate the fact that it is actually beautiful . 

It even has a pretty good story . 

The end result is that I think it s worth your money at the theater . 

Its greatly disappointing in ways , but it s the kind of disappointment that can only come from having such great potential . 

Ive always been easy on movies that try to do something excellent and fail , and Im not of a mind to change that now . 

I should qualify that , because the question of whether or not the creators were actually trying to do something excellent ( as opposed to something that would win awards ) is open to debate , and frankly , Im not sure which side Im on . 

Whatever the case may be there , lets just say that something excellent almost happened . 

At the end of the movie , Captain Algren has a final conversation with the Emperor of Japan that curiously relays my ultimate feelings on the movie . 

The Emperor asks Algren to do something , and Algren responds by telling him to do something else . 

Its actually a great line , though it is a line that only fits a far better version of the movie . 

The conversation fits my feelings about the movie , because I thought this was going to be a movie about Algrens response , but it turns out it was only about the Emperors initial quesiton . 

OK , I'm not going to lie to you here . 

I was pretty disappointed with movie in general after watching Bad Boys II on Wednesday night . 

It was the kind of movie that makes you rethink whether you ever want to see another movie . 

I quickly ran out to the local theater to catch The Last Samurai , lest I allow Michael Bay to achieve his ultimate goal of driving movie lovers back to their TV sets ( I've determined that has to be the explanation for the Bruckheimer/Bay relationship...the less people go to the movies , the more that can be at home tuning into CSI and Cold Case ) . 

I'd heard the hype , I'm not opposed to Tim Cruise in general ( even if I did waste seven dollars seeing Vanilla Sky in theaters ) , and I went under the impression that after the travesty I'd just seen in Bad Boys II , anything out there would probably be look like Citizen Kane in comparison . 

What I saw instead was an actual contender for best movie of 2003 honors . 

The Last Samurai is a "historical " epic set in the 1870's , as Japan started to move towards joining the ways of the modern ( Western ) world . 

As the old ways started to clash with the new ones , the new emperor decides to enlist experts in the Western ways , including Captain Nathan Algren ( played by the aforementioned Tom Cruise ) of the US Army . 

Algren , a soldier who's personal demons has driven him to hard times , is brought in to train the Japanese military in the ways of modern warfare . 

Mind you , this shouldn't be all that hard , as the military is using guns , while the opposing force of Samuria warriors is using bows , arrows and swords . 

Unforturately for Algren , the Japanese leaders disregard his concerns of their readiness , and send their unprepared forces into battle . 

Three minutes late , the military is defeated , and Algren is a captive of the " savages " . 

Wounded and in the hands of the enemy , Algren is surprised by the relative kindness he is shown . 

Slowly but surely , he begins to know and love the ways of the Samurai , eventually turning his back on his former ways and comrades . 

Without revealing any more about the movie , I'll just note that I was mildly dissatisfied with the Hollywood ending to the movie . 

I felt the story could have gone in a better direction ( is that vague enough for you ? ) . 

Ok , let's get started off by saying this is easily one of the top movies of the year . 

As a matter of fact , I'd go so far as to say it's the best movie that I have seen so far this year ( mind you , the top two critically acclaimed films of the year , Cold Mountain and Lord of the Rings : Return of the King , have yet to be released ) . 

Now people who have read my reviews before will know that just last week , I was heaping praise upon Master and Commander . 

Here's why The Last Samurai is a better picture : Master and Commander is a good movie carried by a great performance by Russell Crowe ; Last Samurai is a great film complimented by a great performance by Tom Cruise . 

Speaking of Cruise , when he decide not to suck ? 

This is probably his most challenging role of his career , and he proved that he was more up to the task . 

Cruise seemed to immerse himself in the role like I can't remember him ever doing before . 

We watch him transform from a drunkard haunted by his past to a warrior who has found peace and redemption for the life he has led . 

Now while I'm read to throw the guy an Oscar nomination right now , it might just be due to the fact that I've come to expect far less out of him . 

Regardless , I wouldn't be far off if I said this is one of the his greatest performances . 

The rest of the cast is phenomenal , but none greater than Ken Watanabe . 

Watanabe plays Katsumoto , the leader of the remaining Samurai who captures and later befriends Captain Algren . 

If anyone in the movie gave a better performance than Cruise , it was him . 

Throw in a slew of other top performances , and you have quite a nice little pic . 

What really made this movie for me , though , was its pace and flow . 

Never slow and never boring , director Edward Zwick manages to find that rare balance between action and drama that all directors strive for , but rarely attain . 

It's very hard to keep an audience interested in a 144 minute movie from start to finish , but with a stellar storyline and breath-taking scenery , Last Samurai achieves that goal in spades . 

On a scale of one to five , Last Samurai is a seven . 

This movie gets two thumbs way up from me , and should be in the serious running for an Oscar nomination ( with LOTR:ROTK the clear favorite to win every major award in the world this year , I think a nom is the best that can be hoped for ) . 

I give this movie the highest recommendation , and can lock Last Samurai in as a guaranteed top three movie of the year . 

Go see this movie . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot . 

Admittedly , I was concerned about this film beforehand . 

While I think Tom Cruise is one of the best mega-star actors Hollywood has to offer , I was concerned that The Last Samurai could do for him what Braveheart did for Mel Gibson and Gladiator did for Russell Crowe : swell their egos past their abilities . 

Thankfully , this film works well enough by its own right that it does nt have to keep Cruise in the limelight all the time ; and hes quite happy to have it that way . 

The movie is respectful enough of its subject matter not to put all the glory around its central character and that is what helps this movie to shine . 

The Last Samurai tells the story of Capt . 

Nathan Algren ( Cruise ) , a courageous American soldier who is plagued by the guilt of a slaughter of innocent Indians ordered by his commanding officer . 

Using whats left of his fame to sell Winchester rifles , Algren spends his days in solitude drowning in a bottle . 

That is , until he gets an offer from the Japanese government for $ 500 per week to train their soldiers to fight against a band of Samurai who have rebelled against their quest for modernization . 

But it is only after his band of hastily trained soldiers is attacked and Algren is captured by the rebels that he learns of their true fight : to preserve their way of life that is being threatened by western civilization . 

Through contact with these enemies  he is able to learn of honor , value and love . 

Im sure the cynics will say a movie like this throws the audience into melodrama , but theyll likely say the same about any film in which we are expected to genuinely care about the characters . 

Cruise is a fine lead actor , never stealing the spotlight , but always commanding enough presence for us to believe the film . 

And while I was nt always buying him as a genuine Samurai , he throws himself into the role with such determination that he deserves to be commended for his efforts , despite the fact that he is a Hollywood megastar ( which is hard to see past , regardless of how good the performance is . ) 

Katsumoto , The leader of the Samurai village , is played with an Oscar-worthy performance by Ken Wanatabe , and is easily the films best character . 

He is a fierce , honorable warrior , but also a loving leader who seeks to understand that which is outside his culture . 

Of the films villains , I cant be so praiseworthy . 

While they do work fine in the framework of the story , they are the same static antagonists we see in every film like this , where their lust for progress  gets in the way of human dignity , although , perhaps this can be blamed on the story itself . 

Dont get me wrong , the story is great . 

It works perfectly for the film , because this is a character drama and a war epic , not a story-driven film . 

There is no need for an overly complex plot , because what were expected to be drawn to here is these people and why theyre so willing to fight for what they believe in . 

It may not be wholly original at all , but it works . 

And that s all that matters . 

That being said , the film settles into that mold and shines beautifully . 

The environments here are breathtaking . 

The valley where the Samurai village resides is quite possibly one of the most beautiful set pieces in cinematic history . 

Its citizens are well portrayed as well . 

These are not savage warriors as the early goings of the film would have us believe , but they are families , fathers fighting to give their children some tradition to cherish . 

The costumes are spot on , especially the Samurai armor . 

When we first meet them thundering through terrestrial mists on horseback , it truly is a fearsome sight . 

The film is beautifully scored , from the soft pieces of quiet reflection to the epic pieces of battle , and is probably one of the only soundtracks so far this year that might be worth buying ( Return of the King being the exception ) . 

Hans Zimmer captures everything good about the film and translates it musically . 

And the fight scenes , oh the fight scenes ! 

Wow ! 

The film is intensely violent and has a body count that could rival even Kill Bill . 

Its not simply all out war , but it s stylistic in its approach as well . 

The film has one-on-one sword fighting , finding a windswept and rain-soaked Cruise continually training himself in the way of the Samurai . 

There is a carefully plotted final battle that does nt cheat the viewer by simply having the soldiers run out and kill each other . 

The Samurai fight for their honor against thousands of Japanese infantry , and the battle is simply spectacular . 

It is perfectly shot and perfectly directed to an emotional resonance not often found outside something like Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings . 

Zwick even respects the intelligence of the viewer by knowing the importance of military strategy in battle . 

It is a truly epic thing to see , with characters we have come to care for fighting for everything they believe . 

Theres even a scene with Samurai VS Ninjas ! 

It does nt get much better than that . 

And you can quote me that the final battle here is epic enough that it could rival even Pellannor Fields in Return of the King 

Amidst the battle scenes are long moments of quiet reflection , light humor , and poignant dialogue , all of which serve to draw us further into the story and connect emotionally with the characters . 

Cruise trains fiercely with the town warriors , refusing to stop until he can no longer move , and earning the respect of the villagers . 

He becomes a friend to the people , and a father figure to the village children . 

In short , he realizes that these people are not the bad guys . 

Theyre noble men of good character who only wish to preserve that which they have grown to love . 

Katsumoto says to Nathan on the dawn of battle , You think a man can change his destiny ?  to which Cruise replies ,  I believe a man does what he can , until his destiny is revealed .  

Good stuff . 

The Last Samurai is an epic action film that has a heart and a brain . 

There is intelligence , emotion , humor , and style . 

It slows down to let us connect with its characters , and then it throws those characters into a visual orgy of blood and carnage . 

The movie conveys the strength of the Samurai and the honor they live by , and the beauty of the ancient Japanese culture . 

Everything about this film is beautiful and I would go as far as to rank it one of the years best films . 

Plot Details : This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot . 

I will not rest until I get the word out this is one of the best movies out for 2003 ! 

It is not quite perfect , but is the only film I've seen since X2 that succeeds on almost every level it set out to attain . 

As I'm not the first review here , everyone should know the story by now . 

Cruise is a Civil War hero who drowns his sins liquor every chance he can from the atrocities he has seen and done to the Native Americans . 

He gets hired to train a new "western " style army for the Emperor of Japan , but gets captured after a failed first attempt at defeating the Samurai rebellion . 

From there ...you'll just have to see the movie ! 

Honestly I have been looking forward to this movie for about a year . 

I forced my reluctant wife ( who had no interest ) to see it , and she left the theatre happily surprised . 

For me who had such high expectations this did not disappoint . 

The story , I must say , is fictional . 

So please disregard all those'not historically correct' complaints you may read . 

The director has said upfront they tried to be extremely accurate on all things for that era , but the story is not a true one . 

Yes it does have its predictable moments , but for me this did not distract from enjoying an epic tale . 

Costumes will win an Oscar . 

These are by far the most exquiste creations I've seen all year . 

Of course I'm talking about the Samurai armor first and foremost . 

Although we see Cruise's on all the promotional material , his is not the best you've seen yet . 

Acting wise , Cruise stays on top of his game , no I don't think it is " Oscar-worthy " despite the amount of training he did for the role , but he really hasn't been better . 

My 3 favorite performances of his were from Jerry Maguire , Minority Report , and Interview with the Vampire , and this movie falls right in line . 

He does perform a good character transition from his tortured past to his appreciation and earnest learning of the Samurai way . 

Many of the other supporting characters were also very good , but I could see Ken Watanabe being nominated as he delivers a wide range from a warrior's strength to a father's compassion . 

There were plenty of masterfully crafted ( physical ) special effects , but were there any visual effects ? 

I honestly couldn't say . 

Yes , most certainly , but they are so well conceived I felt I've seen the first action (epic )movie that looked entirely real and natural ....in a long time . 

How can I not be blow away from the intense battle scenes ! 

We have Samurai in full gear fighting , we have Ninjas ! 

( Yes as lethal as you can imagine . ) 

Never have you seen the Samurai sword wielded with such amazing skill ...by everyone in this film . 

The choreography of these fights (especially the opening attack and Ninja raid ) are breathtaking . 

Actually as " cool " as this can be , the grisly deaths should leave you feeling a bit uneasy about what it means to kill another person and how utterly horrible war can be and the devestation it leaves , unless you're completely de-sensitized . 

Last but not least I shouldn't forget to mention the gorgeous cinematagraphy and score . 

Here we see more , and new beautiful venues of the New Zealand . 

I truly believe I was looking at ancient Japan , as it once was . 

If anything go see the movie just to witness its jaw-dropping landscapes ! 

I am a big fan of Hans Zimmer as I have both his Black Hawk Down and Gladiator scores . 

He does such a well job of blending in the grand with the eclectic you always get something new for each endeavor . 

Here will be the next soundtrack I purchase . 

For the first time in awhile I actually experienced the music in a film as much as the film itself . 

The main theme had the spirit of a Gladiator or Last of the Mohicans , but obviously with a Far East influence . 

It was a lush , rich , emotionally charged piece of music . 

The one caveat I had is the ending . 

It lost the movie momentum , felt wishy-washy and rushed to clear up all possible lose ends of the story . 

The writers didn't know how to properly close it so they stamped it with the all too typical "hollywood hero " end . 

Spoiler . 

Skip ahead now ! 

Begin Rant ... 

How ridiculous is it every Samurai gets killed on the battlefield except Algren , especially when they let loose the heavy artillery on the charging Samurai . 

Pretty lame the way he only gets hit a few times , and I would say minor recoverable wounds at best , in relation to every other warrior getting riddled with lethal hits . 

End Rant ... 

End Spoiler 

Regardless of a couple faults this is one of the most beautifully shot , emotionally-invested , incredibly detailed movie of the year . 

Reviewers Note : I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I was allowed , 1/2 star deduction for the ending . 

Edited ( 12/12/03 ) to correct the mistakes in my rant after a 2nd viewing .
